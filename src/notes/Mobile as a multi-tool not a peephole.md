This is something that companies making AR products seem to always get wrong: instead of using the phone as a narrow window to a different reality, use the phone as a multi-tool. 

## Examples:

*Note that we already have **some** of these features, yet the camera is still a camera first, not a Swiss Army Knife, but an old key you opened that beer bottle with.*

- better, more context aware cameras
	- object recognition
	- interacting with the physical world: I point at an appliance and the camera offers contextual ways of controlling it, e.g. turning on a lamp, controlling my media player
- using gestures and haptic feedback
	- in an AR game, draw a glyph with your phone to cast a spell
- using sound and biofeedback
	- still, the best, most immersive form of AR is going for a walk through a busy street, putting on noise-cancelling headphones, and letting Jon Hopkins suddenly move you to a different world. It's still the same street, your feet are still touching the same ground, but there's a new layer of reality on top. Your heartbeat changes, the world around you, your body and the music rhyme.

Inspirations (very TODO, need to copy over notes):

- No Man's sky, 1970s sci-fi
- Fallout
