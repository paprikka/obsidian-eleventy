#fleeting 

Example: [this note](<../Why is it So Hard to Respond to Positive Comments>) took 4 hours to write. At the same time, I updated and edited 7 articles in less than a day, purely because I could not afford not to do so. None of them turned out to be drastically worse.

Creativity requires a) divergent thinking to generate ideas, and b) convergent thinking to find the good ones.

Divergent thinking hates deadlines but the fuel of convergent thinking is focus. Deadlines/constraints bring focus.
