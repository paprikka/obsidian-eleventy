![two worms hugging, a black cloud holding a fork and a knife, one worm is looking away, terrified, another one -- is facing the cloud and smiling, he's blind](https://res.cloudinary.com/dlve3inen/image/upload/v1705513270/card-sit_jxfj32.png)

In August 2020 I decided to open my calendar to strangers from anywhere in the world to talk about their ideas and their dreams, to pair program, or to rant.

> [!info] **Read about it [here](https://sonnet.io/posts/hi).**

By the time of writing this (2024-01-17) I've met more than **150 beautifully weird and kind** people via [Say Hi](https://sonnet.io/posts/hi).  Examples include (random sample):

- students,
- teachers,
- developers,
- artists,
- homeless hackers,
- CEOs,
- a monk,
- a doctor,
- a clown,
- a politician (also, possibly, a clown),
- toy makers and cat herders.

A bunch of people asked me to write about Say Hi (*why*, *how*, *practicalities*). So let's use this space to keep them in order. However, the main reason I'd like to write about this here is much simpler: this experience made my world bigger, and I'm one of those annoying people who, once they see something they find beautiful -- they'll try to tell everyone in the world about it.

The difficult part: I care about the subject so much and I feel like I've learned so much that writing about it feels daunting ([Perfectionism is All or Nothing](<../Perfectionism is All or Nothing>))! 

So, here's what we're going to do: I'll get a taste of my own medicine, the same one I've been serving to my colleagues and interlocutors over all those calls: [Share your unfinished, scrappy work](<../Share your unfinished, scrappy work>).

This post acts as an umbrella for all of the Say Hi related content. Some of the questions we'll try to answer:

- What are Say Hi calls?
- Why do that?
- Why **not** to?
- How to start?
- How to organise and schedule calls? (+ other admin-related tips)
- [Who else is doing this?](<../Say Hi in the Wild>)
- Why did **I** start talking to strangers in this fashion?
- *Add your own question [here](mailto:hello@sonnet.io)*


Eventually, I'd like to turn this into a separate site, a community tool for fostering deeper interactions between people. 

I dislike FAQs ([FAQs are a Dark Orange Flag](<../FAQs are a Dark Orange Flag>)), but I think FAQs is a good first step. We'll iterate.
