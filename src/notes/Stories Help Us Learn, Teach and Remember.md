(very much wip and #fleeting)

I really enjoyed reading [Concise explanations accelerate progress](https://stephango.com/concise) but there was a part of that note that just didn't gel with me. I needed a few weeks to let it ferment in my head into something coherent enough to share. I hope you like kimchi.

It's not that I disagree with Steph, I think he makes a valid point. If I were to boil it down to one sentence, and oversimplify it along the way, I'd say:  concise explanations accelerate progress *because they're more actionable* ([Communication is Action](<../Communication is Action>)).

What about stories? Stories help us remember. Stories help us understand. We learn through stories. 

This applies to individuals and cultures.

- stories help us remember, we learn through stories
- societies remember through stories: 
	- oral theory
		- rhythm, rhymes melody 
- if you want to memorise a deck of cards, create a story about it
- is there a connection to spaced repetition? [Matt Klinestiver](<../Matt Klinestiver>)
