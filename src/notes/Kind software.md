[Working Definition](<../Operational Definition>):

1. Kind software supports my own well-being (mine as that of the user or author).
2. It doesn't get in my way, it doesn't try to extract value from me. 
3. It doesn't actively make the world a worse place.
4. It is sustainable, not greedy.
	1. as the author, I charge as much as I need to make it work, within the framework of my own life.
	2. If it's not sustainable, we scale it down enough to make it such and give the smallest possible thing.
		1. If the smallest possible (sustainable) thing doesn't exist, move on.
5. Kind software is **good enough**, it [doesn't change for the sake of change, or greed](<../Proteus - Uncertainty is the only Certainty>).

A VC-backed soon-to-be-unicorn vs. a lifestyle business is a false dichotomy. People who say that tend to forget that carpenters, cleaners or people operating funeral houses exist.
