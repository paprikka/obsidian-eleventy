I was trying to work on [Night Rider](<../Night Rider>), but unfortunately I'm cursed by a secret group of Cupertino-based warlocks: every time I start a new SwiftUI project, I need to spend hours fixing Xcode. It was still worth the hassle, not just because I finally succeeded, but because I stumbled upon a small project I completely forgot about. After all, it *is* about the journey, thank you [Ursula](<../Ursula K. Le Guin>)!

Spiritual Volleyball has neither end nor purpose. It's just two ghosts playing volleyball.  Set in a picturesque beach scenery, with palm trees, little crosses and the classic *By the Seaside* (composed by no one other than Tim Apple) playing in the distance.

*Note the bug where the net is too short and both players end up on the same side of the screen.*

## Why I made it

Three reasons: toys, side-hugs, and abandonware

### New Toys

A few years back, Unity Engine released the first version of their [post-processing pipeline](https://docs.unity3d.com/2018.2/Documentation/Manual/PostProcessingOverview.html). Suddenly adding effects like chromatic aberration, grain, colour grading became trivial. I had some doodles I wanted to turn into a game and thought I could make them look better with little effort.

### Hugs

Testing any UI on the screen, vs. holding a physical object in your hand can result in completely different kinds of interactions. For instance, consider its shape, weight, or texture. Consider the distance between your eyes and the screen. Originally, the multiplayer mode of the game wasn't meant to be played on a computer screen, but on a phone.

The mobile UI was arranged in a way that the *jump* and *move* controls were placed on the opposite sides of the phone. This way the most comfortable way to play the game was a side-hug! 

This didn't work out for a variety of reasons (phone screen size, input margin of error). I found another proof that trying to be creative when coming up with input systems generally backfires. And that's a good thing! My first "walking sim": [How to Run an All-hands Meeting](https://rafsters.itch.io/all-hands) was inspired by what I'd learned here and uses terrible user input controls as a game mechanic.


### Abandonware

At the time I was thinking about a series of smaller playthings, inspired by old NES games (think Spiritual Motocross - the modern interpretation of [Excitebike](https://www.ranker.com/review/excitebike/966857?l=1883477), [Hyper Olympic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Track_%26_Field_(video_game)), or Spiritual Wrestling!). 

## Download

In order to download the game, you'll need to catch the marquee mouse:

<marquee style='font-size:2em'><a href='https://drive.google.com/file/d/14dgrirI-87XlQPT5SBs7y_aJnPf0JuQr/view?usp=share_link'>üêÅ. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;haha you'll never get mee</a></marquee>

[or just click here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/14dgrirI-87XlQPT5SBs7y_aJnPf0JuQr/view?usp=share_link)
The binary is not signed so you'd have to right click to open it.

### Here are some games I actually finished and published:

- Tommy The Toe and the Chamber of Hostile Carpentry ([AppStore](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/tommy-the-toe/id1498417487), [Trailer](https://www.reddit.com/r/iosgaming/comments/f4bkov/my_girlfriend_broke_a_toe_so_i_made_a_game_about/?ref=share&ref_source=link))
- [How to Run an All-hands Meeting](https://rafsters.itch.io/all-hands) 

Thanks for reading, see you tomorrow!

P.S. It seems that [wikiHow has not just 1 but 4 ways of reversing curses](https://www.wikihow.com/Reverse-a-Curse), I think I might give it a go and 10x my SwiftUI skills.
