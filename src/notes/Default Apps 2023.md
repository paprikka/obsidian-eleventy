This little exercise was inspired by [Chris Coyer](https://chriscoyier.net/2023/11/25/default-apps-2023/), who was inspired by [Matt C](https://mattcool.tech/posts/default-apps-2023/)... who was inspired by [Tracy Durnell](https://tracydurnell.com) and the [HomeBrew Website Club](https://events.indieweb.org). I think it'll be fun to make another list like this next year and compare with this one.

Also, I've attached a template <span style="color: red">below</span> in case you wan to do this yourself.


## Defaults

📨 Mail Client: Apple Mail
📮 Mail Server: Google :(
📝 Notes: [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) and Apple Notes/[Concepts](https://concepts.app/en/) when I think in pictures

🖥️ Terminal: iTerm2
🕹️ Games: PS4, Switch, Itch.io, Steam for new stuff



### Stuff that doesn't fit above: 

- [Rectangle](https://rectangleapp.com) — quickly arrange windows on the screen without touching the mouse (actually useful and takes almost no time to learn)
- GrandPerspective — because I should've bought a bigger SSD, and Docker is a hungry beast
- [Raycast](https://www.raycast.com) — app launcher/Spotlight alternative (ignore the plugins, download for a faster search experience)
- UTM — where [Bob](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utjh8R-yedk) [lives](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3tIgaJ1j7w)
- Transmission — someone installed it on my computer, I don't know what it does, but I'm afraid to remove it.
- [Fork](https://git-fork.com) — Git GUI
- VLC — once my grandfather threw an old potato at it and it played it back in 4K, in 1946!
- Anki — a flashcards tool for spaced repetition learning

## Observations:

Most of my apps come into these categories:

![a pie chart with 20% apple, 15% obsidian, 10% of my own apps](app-usage-2023.webp)

Generally I prefer having multiple, smaller tools communicating with each other via well-defined interfaces (think: an app as a single atomic verb vs. a computer program as a noun/environment). Obsidian is an exception here, perhaps because it operates on text files as a primitive, making interoperability and portability trivial.

**I don't recall a single moment when I missed Adobe.** The [Alternatives to Adobe](<../Alternatives to Adobe>) might be cheaper or significantly less evil but most importantly: they have much better UX. And that's despite 20 years of Photoshop muscle memory, which are hard to fight.

Compared to the last year, Obsidian moved from a note taking/knowledge management tool to a multi-tool I use with most of my research, planning, writing and [publishing](<../Abusing and reviewing Obsidian Publish>). Main reason: I don't use many plugins and markdown is easily portable, so I'm not  worried about vendor lock-in. I used VS Code this way before, so the switch came naturally.

Initially I felt like the original list felt a little bit... dated? 1/3 of the tools I use live on my phone or tablet. Who cares about your mail client, in 2023? But then I realised that I mistook *unused* for *boring*. Email *is* boring. Apple Mail is even more boring as it feels like someone stopped developing it a decade ago. And that's actually good.
