Prophetic god of rivers and seas. His name means: "first" (from [Greek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_language "Greek language") "πρῶτος" _prōtos_, "first"), to be understood as primordial.

His domain would be *elusive sea change*, reflecting the unpredictable nature of water.
He can predict the future, but in order to make him do so, you'll need to find a way to capture him.
