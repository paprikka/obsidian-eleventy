I used to keep a tiny notebook where every evening I'd put 2-3 beautiful things I'd noticed the day before. Most of these bullet points were really short, almost never full sentences (*the light falling on X's face on a particular evening*, *a friendly spider dancing to a song by Bauhaus*, *a dying fly*, *an unusual sound*, *a mysterious soup*.) 

It's funny to see these notes today and notice how vivid are the memories triggered by them. It was my personal time travel kit.

Nowadays, I keep a similar section in my [Stream of Consciousness Morning Notes](<../Stream of Consciousness Morning Notes>), but I don't aim for uniqueness, because although unique notes evoke a more powerful feeling, I'll never get bored of playing with my dog or hugging Luna and I want to do that as often as possible.
