This time instead of sending a newsletter about the Indie Web, I thought I'd share some of the sources I rely on to put it together.

Happy Holidays!

Disclaimer and probably the worst possible start of a post like this:

**This list is neither complete nor 100% focussed on the Indie Web.** Some of the people I follow often post stuff *unrelated* to Indie Web. But, when they *do* post Indie Web related content, it's usually something so good I want to let you know about it.

## How I use these resources

- find inspiration for new posts and project ideas
- write the weekly newsletter (like [this one](<../TIL/weekly/48>))
- escape the [Cable TV Web](<../Cable TV Web>)
- find more interesting people to follow

## Other

I often check the domain names associated with the email addresses of people who message me with feedback or contact me via [Say Hi](https://sonnet.io/posts/hi).

### Niche and tech-specific sites or forums, e.g.:

- Svelte Discord
- Shader Park Discord
- Tauri Discord
- Next.js Discord (less so nowadays, too SaaS/grift heavy)
- [Kirbysites | Frontend/Backend Inspiration](https://www.kirbysites.com)

I'm not very active on those, reasons:

- I don't like that Discord is trying to build a closed forum ecosystem.
- They tend to have a low signal-noise ratio and a bias towards commercial content.
