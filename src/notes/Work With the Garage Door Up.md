#fleeting (very much a draft)

[Share your unfinished, scrappy work](<../Share your unfinished, scrappy work>)

Reasons:

- there's something beautiful about showing your work regularly
- it's more honest
- it celebrates the process, not just the results
- it helps me become less shy (like with drawings or charging for Enso)
- it keeps me accountable
- it allows for better feedback
