Features like [FLOC](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/03/googles-floc-terrible-idea), or WEI ([Web Environment Integrity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Environment_Integrity)) pushed by Alphabet make it harder to maintain anonymity and control over the way we access information on the web, by making it harder to control our identity.

User Agent spoofing is a feature, not a bug. It allows the users to tell the server: this is how you should speak to me. This is the persona I want to assume. It's not the most elegant solution, but it is less prone to fingerprinting than the alternatives.

This is akin to using [real names vs. pseudonyms](<../real names vs. pseudonyms>) online. Pseudonyms allow for multiple identities you control, whereas forcing the user to use a real name allows to track them in different context and makes it hard/illegal to forge an identity.

Adtech has an obsession with having a single, targetable entry point to your life, and they know that they can't get consent ([Rapist mentality](<../Rapist mentality>)). 

This reminds me of the [Basic forms of social freedom](<../Basic forms of social freedom>), especially the right to move away and the right to disobey.  I want to be able to reveal myself to the world when and how I would like to ([Privacy and Secrecy](<../Privacy and Secrecy>)).

Besides FLOC, and WEI there are also Web Hints--a more structured, but falsifiable alternative to UA.
