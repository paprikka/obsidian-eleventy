If you want to test an idea, and that idea does not require you to use a proprietary technology, always bet on the web.

We don't appreciate how beautifully, unbelievably easy it is to build and share using the Web Platform. In *less than 30 seconds* I can share my app with the entire planet, completely for free.

I'm saying that as someone who has worked with mobile for more than a decade, as a dev, as a CTO of a mobile-first company and as a founder of a mobile-first business. So yes, naturally I have strong opinions here! And still, I really, really wish I were wrong. **Nothing beats the Web Platform when it comes to short feedback loops and ease of experimentation.** 

This is precisely why we should care about open standards. Moats and closed solutions make us collectively less capable and more stupid.
