This is about two games that never happened and probably will never happen. I find their mechanics somewhat interesting and I wish I could play them myself. But they died early, buried under a pile of more useful projects. A partial inspiration for those games was my work in ad-tech, and stories about fantastically insatiable Czech demon-tree-babies (more on that in the [footnotes](<../Demon Tamagotchis>)).

## \<unnamed detective game\>

A short detective game relying on object recognition. It went roughly like this: you’ve found yourself in the service of a demon who communicates with you through your phone and requires small sacrifices in exchange for fame and wealth – letting you live deliciously. Perhaps you found him by accident, one night, slightly inebriated, getting a cheeky kebab on [Old Street](<../best Kebab on Old Street>), receiving a business card from a tech bro working nearby, via AirDrop.

Your errands involve collecting the souls of people and things around you ([Everything is Alive](<../Everything is Alive>)). These errands will be shared through a daily message, often those messages will contain a dossier of the victim: a photograph, plus a few lines about them.

In practice, this means *going outside* with your phone and taking a photo of an object related to your quest, for instance: *a black cat*, *a flower*, *a photograph*, *a knife*, etc. Taking a photo means capturing their soul. [Mobile as a multi-tool not a peephole](<../Mobile as a multi-tool not a peephole>). 

*Technical note: in my implementation images were processed using the Google [Cloud Vision API](https://cloud.google.com/vision/), now you can do most of it on-device.*

To summarise, the game progression looked roughly like this:

1. Set up your character: a selfie, plus 2-3 lines about you.
2. Receive the first assignments, pretty innocent (almost cheesy) at first: *I need the soul of a rose*, *I need the soul of the colour blue*.
3. The assignments gradually become more sinister, ethically dubious: *I need the soul of a squirrel*, *a cat*. If sent the dossier of a person, you need to collect some objects belonging to them, tied to their story (e.g. a hat, a stethoscope, see [sympathetic magic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sympathetic_magic)). (important: none of that involves taking pictures of real people)
4. The final dossier arrives. This time with your own name and face.

## Demon Tamagotchi

The Tamagotchi game is based on a simplified version of the *\<untitled detective game\>*: 

You plant a little seed on your phone, let it hatch and grow. Let's call it Pickles. Yeah, Pickles has a good ring to it. You feed it by showing it pictures of fruit, food, perhaps some unusual stuff like pickles. 

Then, those requests start getting a bit weirder: "show me a cat", "show me a picture of your facebook feed". Pickles, now calling himself *úkuš* (*cucumber* in Sumerian), needs you to take a selfie.

Pickles is an ancient Mesopotamian demon, named after [the holiest of all vegetables](<../the holiest of all vegetables>). He eventually steals your data, your soul, and replaces you with a doppelganger.
