Sometimes a seemingly small change can cascade into a completely different reality. 

What if we had two moons?
What if disco never happened?
What if mullets were never a thing?
What if people hatched from eggs, buried deep in the ground. When we died, we would be put back into our shells. Planted like seeds.

It's hard to distinguish between small and drastic changes, especially if we had to extrapolate the entire universe based on a single variable change. It feels like the world with two moons would be so much different.

If we hatched from eggs, how would we approach sexuality, eroticism, architecture, religion? Would our cities look like giant palm trees, mirroring an equally tree-like structure beneath the ground?

Or would cemeteries and nurseries become the same place? Would we still love dogs or have lizards and platypuses as pets? Whatâ€™s a peach?
