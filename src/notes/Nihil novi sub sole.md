> Nothing new under the sun
> â€“ *Vulgata*, the Battlestar Galactica 1978 of Christian Theology 

### Associations:

- sounds almost the same in Romanian (*Nimic nou sub soare*)
- _**Nihil novi nisi commune consensu**_: the [1505](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nihil_novi) Act of Constitution of the Polish Commonwealth parliament establishing the so called *Golden Liberty* (nobles' democracy).
	- I keep misremembering it as *nihil novi* meaning *nothing new*, in the sense that the laws turned out to change nothing (which is incorrect, I'm thinking about later laws introduced in the XVIII cent.). 
		- I'm keeping this note mainly as a reminder for myself.
