In [Projects and apps I built for my own well-being](<../Projects and apps I built for my own well-being>) I mentioned projects that already exist and are *relatively* stable. This post will focus on the stuff I'm actively developing and hope to eventually share, and on the things that I hope one day someone smarter than me will build!


In my work I want to be kind and curious, and these ideas would fall under the umbrella of *kind software*. Here's a [working definition](<../Kind software>) (I'll flesh it out more in a future update).

## Wishlist

I'll come up with nicer names, I promise.

### [Mental Health Toolbox (working title)](<../Mental Health Toolbox (working title)>)

A mobile/web-app with a list of tools you can reach out to when you're feeling down, stressed, anxious, low on motivation. It's highly personalised and co-created with the user. 

**It's very low-tech.** In fact you can imagine it as a deck of Pokemon/MtG cards, where each card is a thing you can *do* or *think of* to get out of your own head and respond to whatever challenge lies ahead of you, constructively.

### [Pickle](<../Pickle>)

A *metronome* for my attention (not a timer, not a trademark-protected [nightshade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solanaceae)). 

The main features include an adaptive task/rest cycle duration, allowing me to switch context quickly and work within the rhythm of my own attention span.
### [An everything canvas](<../An everything canvas>)

An infinite canvas/thinking tool that doesn't operate on images, text, media, but *objects*. An object could be static like a media file or a piece of text, but it could also be a small computer program, or a primitive dealing with transforming information.

### [Pierogi](<../Pierogi>)

A voice/thought recorder for accent-challenged people like myself.
