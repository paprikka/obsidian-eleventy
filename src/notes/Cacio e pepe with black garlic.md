I didn't know anyone in London when I moved there, so I decided to meet new people by cooking for them every two weeks. This is the dish I'd cook for my first-time visitors.

*Cacio e pepe* means *cheese and pepper*. Adding black garlic changes this dish quite a bit: it feels meatier, less cheesy and the spiciness of pepper pops out a bit more. I've fed it to a bunch of Italians and at least one chef without gaining any mortal enemies, so you should be fine eating it.

For 3-4 people, cooking time: 20-40 minutes

The key to get this dish right is to ensure we get the smooth, silky texture when mixing the starches from pasta water with the cheese. This is a fairly time-sensitive process, so I recommend reading this recipe twice and do as much of the prep work in advance as possible. Good luck!

### Wine pairing

Chianti, Rioja or Primitivo work really well with this dish (peppery/full of tannins is good, sweet, plum jam like not as much). If you live in the UK, check out Campo Viejo Rioja, it's good value and widely available.

## Ingredients:

- **240-320g of dry, 100% semolina pasta: bucatini (traditional), linguine or spaghetti.**
	- Avoid egg pasta. We need something fairly starchy, de Cecco is an easily available, safe choice here.
- **120-170g Pecorino Romano or Parmigiano Reggiano**
	- The more mature, the better. Parmesan works perfectly fine. Pecorino is the traditional choice. A 50/50 mix of pecorino and parmesan is my favourite.
	- Correction from RafaÅ‚ who moved from ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§ â†’ ðŸ‡µðŸ‡¹: add SÃ£o Jorge, just keep the ratio low (<1/5 of all cheese)
- **Peppercorns â€” ca. 1 tbsp per person + 1 tbsp if you prefer spicier**
- **1tbsp olive oil**
- **(Optional) 1tbps of butter, unsalted**
	- you might want to control the amount of salt, as weâ€™ll be cooking pasta in a small amount of water in a pan
- **Black garlic â€” 1 large clove (or 2 small ones).** Can be found in large Tesco stores, Whole Foods, online or easily made at home (although it takes ages*).
- **Salt**

## Tools:

- 1 pot or a deep pan (I find it easier to use a 4l pot or something like this)
- 1 pan (wide, ideally 5cm deep)
- A slotted spoon or pasta spoon
- A ladle
- Mortar and pestle (alternatively, a meat tenderiser, a tea towel and a career that leaves you with a sense of existential doom)


## Method:

**Critical steps are in bold**, context and details in regular type.


**Grate the cheese (you might not use all of it).**

**Take the black garlic clove and slice it as finely as possible.** Doing so might prove a bit tricky as black garlic tends to have a slightly chocolatey/liquorice-like texture, so donâ€™t obsess about it too much â€” itâ€™ll melt during cooking. Weâ€™re just trying to speed up this process a bit, as weâ€™ll have to deal with other, time-sensitive tasks simultaneously, later.

**Preheat the pan on high/medium-high heat. Once the pan is ready, toss in the peppercorns. After 1-2 minutes give them a quick toss.**
The point is to increase the temperature evenly and avoid peppercorns burning on one side. We want to: 
- make them release the essential oils and 
- become a tad crunchier and easier to crush.

**After another 1-2 min move the peppercorns to the pestle and crush.** Don't grind them too finely. We don't want dust, but little, slightly crunchy .5mm nuggets of spicy joy.

**Put the pan back on the hob on high heat.** Fill it with water up to 1/2â€”3/4 heightâ€”we need just enough water to cover the pasta, but as little as possible. 
Add saltâ€”we need just enough to make the water taste like seawater (donâ€™t worry, most of it wonâ€™t get absorbed).

**Once the water starts boiling, lay down the pasta in the pot, spread it evenly on the surface.** Ensure itâ€™s completely covered so we donâ€™t get those nasty, sticky, dry bits. 

**Cook the pasta for the minimum amount of time specified on the packaging or 1 minute less if preparing this dish for the first time.** This is to avoid overcooking the pasta during the second stage, when we mix everything together.

**Put the 4l pot on the hob and set the heat to medium-high.**

**1-2 minutes before the pasta in the pot is done, add olive oil and peppercorns to the pot.** Leave two, three pinches of crushed peppercorns for decoration.

Now, the important bit:

**Once the pasta is al dente (or ideally, almost al dente), switch off the hob, and start transferring the pasta into the pot. Do. Not. Remove. Pasta. Water.** Try to do it as quickly as possible and occasionally stir the pasta in the pot so it doesnâ€™t stick. It might get a bit messy (at least it does when I do it).

**Now, once all (or most of theâ€¦) pasta is in the pot, start stirring it vigorously. Add butter and black garlic. Whilst stirring, start adding the pasta water (1/2â€“1 ladle to start) and the cheese.** The goal here is to ensure we let all of the ingredients hang out with each other, blend and form a silky, sticky, but not liquid texture. The sauce should not drip from the pastaâ€”if thatâ€™s the case, add more cheese, increase the temperature and crank up the stirring speed to 11! If the sauce gets too dryâ€”add more water, then a small amount of cheese.

**Keep stirring, adding cheese and the pasta water.** Make sure the pasta doesnâ€™t get too soft and overcooked!

At this stage pasta should turn slightly brown due to the melting black garlic. Donâ€™t worry too much if it doesnâ€™tâ€”the most important thing is not to overcook the pasta.

**Done, serve the pasta straight from the dish**. The heat of the pot will remove some of the moisture, but the temperature will help keep the pasta moist and juicy for a bit longer.

Decorate with a pinch of pepper and grated cheese.

Enjoy!
