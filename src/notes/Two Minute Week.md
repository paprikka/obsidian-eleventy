I learned about this idea from the [Future of Coding](https://futureofcoding.slack.com/archives/C0120A3L30R) Slack channel. Here's how it works:

> Once per week, share a 2-minute video explaining the most recent progress on your work.

## Why? 

- To find an excuse/force yourself to articulate what you're thinking about

### To which I'd add:

- To keep yourself accountable
- To get out of your head
- To get more comfortable with [Sharing your unfinished, scrappy work](<../Share your unfinished, scrappy work>)

> This reminds me a little bit of [Screenshot Saturdays](<../Screenshot Saturday>) from the indie game dev community. I used to think that they were more focussed more on accountability rather than getting better at learning how to get across your ideas, but after 30s of skimming through `\#ScreenshotSaturday` on Xitter  I found enough stuff to write about for 2 days, so I'll stop here.

Related [article on the Future of Coding site](https://futureofcoding.org/two-minute-week) has more context and some tips regarding recording your video. Now go and read [it](<../Things you can do when you don't rely on ads>), you handsome beast, you crazy diamond!
