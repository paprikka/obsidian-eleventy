#fleeting  and very WiP

I know that this is obvious to many people reading this. It is obvious to me (except when it isn't.)

I realised very late in my life how important/useful it is to appreciate the results of our work. I use work in a very broad sense, this could be *a thing* I *made*, a thing I *did*, an app I shared, a visit at the climbing gym.

I tend to hyper-focus on the task and move on to the next one as soon as I'm done. This seems pragmatic: your time will be better spent on solving the next problem, making the next thing. I was also brought up to err on the side of modesty.

Here's the problem with this approach:

First, this does not mean that I won't ruminate/worry about something I'm unhappy about.

Not paying attention to successes (broadly defined), or noticing how I felt after making the effort, makes it harder for me to motivate myself to improve. It's just sticks and no carrots.


*Side note: Catechism of the Catholic Church defines Pride/haughtiness as the first Cardinal Sin. (But, the Polish word for pride in this context also means **yummy**.)*
