1\. *My dear, life is but a train! We share it for a brief moment, but people come and go as they please.*

Possibly a riff on [Mark Twain](<../Mark Twain>) but for people who have not read him (me).

2\. *When I go to hell I'll keep the window seat for you.* is something my best friend said to once, and now we say it to each other. When you say it at the age of 15 you're edgy. When you say it at the age of 35, it's wishful thinking (given 1.).
