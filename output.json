Having said that, the recommendations provided by Shepherd are [pretty good](https://shepherd.com/search/book/1484) and some of them ended up on my reading list.\n\n![I don't know how to exit vim, but my IDE is a German techno Jellyfish - YouTube](https://youtu.be/njFhY_vLWJk)\n\n[LazyVim](https://www.lazyvim.org) ‚Äì an easy to configure, no fuss, just add water‚Ñ¢ IDE using NeoVim. \n\nI'm a bit surprised about this one myself.

I think it's an <a href=\"../My%20Ideal%20Writing%20and%20Thinking%20Tool\">almost</a> perfect hypertext editor. In a weird way it's <a href=\"../Tools%20like%20Obsidian%20a%20true%20Web%201.0%20platform\">closer to the spirit of the Web</a> than most web browsers <a href=\"../Cable%20TV%20Web\">cable-tv internet</a>.</p>\n<p>I also immensely enjoy reading, writing and thinking in graphs (<a href=\"../Wikipedia%20rabbit%20holes%20and%20writing%20evergreen%20notes\">Wikipedia rabbit holes and writing evergreen notes</a>): entering someone's mind through a series of associations, rather than a linear stream of notes.</p>\n<p><strong>But this note is about Obsidian <em>Publish</em>, not Obsidian (the <em>authoring/thinking tool</em>).</strong> To make it useful, let's make sure we frame this properly.</p>\n<p>I have fairly specific needs, experience, and biases: I've been building authoring and publishing tools for more than a decade, with clients ranging from a) me, to b) small indie publishers to c) large publishing enterprises. Even Storienteer was a publishing platform in a sense, although with 6 degrees of freedom and (possibly) commute required to navigate the content instead of scrolling, but I digress. The point is ‚Äì I really like this stuff and, for better or worse, <strong>I have opinions‚Ñ¢</strong>!</p>\n<p>Then, I love playing with the Web Platform, either experimenting or just messing with simple HTML templates and CSS. It's one of my favourite forms of expression, it's my LEGOs! (<span style=\"color: red\">How I learned to love the web and stopped worrying about Javascript Fatigue</span>)</p>\n<p>I also publish my content in several places, using a variety of technologies, from markdown, to plain HTML, to Next.js (examples: this site, sonnet.io, potato.horse, most of the mini-app/games and articles on sonnet.io/projects).</p>\n<p>In some ways this makes me a <em>terrible</em> user. I will dislike the things many people probably don't care about, I will err on the side of building my own thing, instead of buying, and try to abuse or hack whatever third-party tools I have at my disposal. Here's <a href=\"../How%20I%20Use%20Obsidian%20to%20Publish%20These%20Notes\">How I Use Obsidian to Publish These Notes</a>.</p>\n<p>In summary, please read <strong>\"bad\"</strong> as <strong>\"doesn't work for Rafa≈Ç\"</strong> and use this more as guidance/brain food.</p>\n<h2>Opinions</h2>\n<h3>Trivial to set up</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>pay for the service</li>\n<li>hit <em>Publish: Publish changes</em></li>\n<li>and, you're done!</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Updates take almost no time to propagate</h3>\n<p>Site updates are lighting fast. I don't recall a moment when I saw a stale version of the site, perhaps besides some custom .css and .js files. Hit <em>Publish</em>, and 5 sec later the changes are there.</p>\n<p>It seems like a small thing, but it makes for a much more pleasant experience than waiting 1 minute for the CDN update when you pushed a typo fix.</p>\n<h3>No proper custom domain support</h3>\n<p>I <strong>strongly</strong> encourage you to keep your email and your published content on your own domain (<a href=\"../Why%20own%20a%20personal%20domain\">Why own a personal domain</a>).</p>\n<p>Currently (2023-11-23) there are two ways of setting up a custom domain:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Cloudflare</li>\n<li>proxy</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I don't use Cloudflare, so I needed to follow the proxy route. <a href=\"https://untested.sonnet.io\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">untested.sonnet.io</a> is a vercel project pointing to <a href=\"https://publish.obsidian.md\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">publish.obsidian.md</a> via redirects (reference config <a href=\"https://github.com/paprikka/untested/blob/314f2f57d3c17ef465f79a7e30818dfd57dc298a/vercel.json\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">here</a>).</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-json\">\"rewrites\": [\n    {\n      \"source\": \"/\",\n      \"destination\": \"https://publish.obsidian.md/serve?url=untested.sonnet.io/\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"source\": \"/:path*\",\n      \"destination\": \"https://publish.obsidian.md/serve?url=untested.sonnet.io/:path*\"\n    }\n  ]\n</code></pre>\n<h4>Two big problems with that:</h4>\n<p><strong>I want to avoid vendor lock-in.</strong> Without a custom domain, if I'm not happy with Obsidian Publish in the future and decide to stop paying for it, I'd lose all of my links shared on social media, my other sites, forums, etc...</p>\n<p>Finally, <strong>using proxies instead of a proper DNS setup is slow</strong> as every request to <a href=\"/\">untested.sonnet.io</a> has to do a round trip via vercel.

I think it's an [almost](<../My Ideal Writing and Thinking Tool>) perfect hypertext editor. In a weird way it's [closer to the spirit of the Web](<../Tools like Obsidian a true Web 1.0 platform>) than most web browsers [cable-tv internet](<../Cable TV Web>). \n\nI also immensely enjoy reading, writing and thinking in graphs ([Wikipedia rabbit holes and writing evergreen notes](<../Wikipedia rabbit holes and writing evergreen notes>)): entering someone's mind through a series of associations, rather than a linear stream of notes.\n\n**But this note is about Obsidian *Publish*, not Obsidian (the *authoring/thinking tool*).** To make it useful, let's make sure we frame this properly.\n\nI have fairly specific needs, experience, and biases: I've been building authoring and publishing tools for more than a decade, with clients ranging from a) me, to b) small indie publishers to c) large publishing enterprises. Even Storienteer was a publishing platform in a sense, although with 6 degrees of freedom and (possibly) commute required to navigate the content instead of scrolling, but I digress. The point is ‚Äì I really like this stuff and, for better or worse, **I have opinions‚Ñ¢**!\n\nThen, I love playing with the Web Platform, either experimenting or just messing with simple HTML templates and CSS. It's one of my favourite forms of expression, it's my LEGOs! (<span style=\"color: red\">How I learned to love the web and stopped worrying about Javascript Fatigue</span>)\n\nI also publish my content in several places, using a variety of technologies, from markdown, to plain HTML, to Next.js (examples: this site, sonnet.io, potato.horse, most of the mini-app/games and articles on sonnet.io/projects). \n\nIn some ways this makes me a *terrible* user. I will dislike the things many people probably don't care about, I will err on the side of building my own thing, instead of buying, and try to abuse or hack whatever third-party tools I have at my disposal. Here's [How I Use Obsidian to Publish These Notes](<../How I Use Obsidian to Publish These Notes>).\n\nIn summary, please read **\"bad\"** as **\"doesn't work for Rafa≈Ç\"** and use this more as guidance/brain food.\n\n## Opinions\n\n### Trivial to set up\n\n- pay for the service\n- hit *Publish: Publish changes*\n- and, you're done!\n\n### Updates take almost no time to propagate\n\nSite updates are lighting fast. I don't recall a moment when I saw a stale version of the site, perhaps besides some custom .css and .js files. Hit *Publish*, and 5 sec later the changes are there.\n\nIt seems like a small thing, but it makes for a much more pleasant experience than waiting 1 minute for the CDN update when you pushed a typo fix.\n\n### No proper custom domain support\n\nI **strongly** encourage you to keep your email and your published content on your own domain ([Why own a personal domain](<../Why own a personal domain>)).\n\nCurrently (2023-11-23) there are two ways of setting up a custom domain: \n\n- Cloudflare\n- proxy\n\nI don't use Cloudflare, so I needed to follow the proxy route. [untested.sonnet.io](https://untested.sonnet.io) is a vercel project pointing to [publish.obsidian.md](https://publish.obsidian.md) via redirects (reference config [here](https://github.com/paprikka/untested/blob/314f2f57d3c17ef465f79a7e30818dfd57dc298a/vercel.json)).\n\n```json\n\"rewrites\": [\n    {\n      \"source\": \"/\",\n      \"destination\": \"https://publish.obsidian.md/serve?url=untested.sonnet.io/\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"source\": \"/:path*\",\n      \"destination\": \"https://publish.obsidian.md/serve?url=untested.sonnet.io/:path*\"\n    }\n  ]\n```\n\n#### Two big problems with that:\n\n**I want to avoid vendor lock-in.** Without a custom domain, if I'm not happy with Obsidian Publish in the future and decide to stop paying for it, I'd lose all of my links shared on social media, my other sites, forums, etc...\n\nFinally, **using proxies instead of a proper DNS setup is slow** as every request to [untested.sonnet.io](/) has to do a round trip via vercel. This is especially noticeable on mobile.\n\n### Performance\n \nNotes with images can take ages to load. At some point this made some of my notes almost useless on mobile. Screenshots or pasted photos are the biggest offenders here because of how PNG compression works. That's unfortunate because copy/paste is a common way of adding content to Obsidian. The reason is that Obsidian Publish acts as a CDN, but it doesn't optimise most of the assets referenced in your notes. \n\n**I can understand why it works this way, but it irks me a bit that the official page states that Obsidian Publish has a 100 Lighthouse score.** \n\nTaking the usefulness of Lighthouse scores aside, that performance related statement is only correct if:\n\n- [ ] You use publish.obsidian.md as your domain **or** you're a CloudFlare customer\n- [ ] You don't use any images in your notes **or** you take care of optimising them yourself ([How to optimise images for Obsidian Publish](<../How to optimise images for Obsidian Publish>))\n\nOne good first step here would be to at least pre-calculate image aspect ratios, so even if they take longer to load, there's no layout shift.\n\nI think the Obsidian team should be a bit more clear about this. \n\n### Accessibility\n\nIt's mostly OK, as markdown and wikilinks allow to specify alt text:\n\n`![a cat](https://.foo.com/picture-of-a-cat.png)` or `<div style='background: red' >local-cat.png</div>`\n\nThings get a bit trickier when I want to use images with captions (\\<figure\\>), because Obsidian doesn't support those.\n\nOne approach is to use plain HTML:\n\n```html\n<figure>\n\t<img src='https://foo.com/cat.png' alt='a cat'>\n\t<figcaption>meow!</figcaption>\n</figure>\n```\n\nIn this case we lose the ability to link to the image in the vault and need to host it ourselves as markdown within HTML blocks is not processed.\n\nAnother one to just use markdown and add a paragraph with the caption below:\n\n```md\n<div style='background: red' >cat.png</div>\n\n*meow*\n```\n\n![6190](TIL/weekly/uncolouring-book-butt-art.png)\n*[Uncolouring Book](https://lines.potato.horse) v. 2 (the Uncolouring Butt)*\n\n\nAccessibility is more than alt tags. The issue with this approach is that although it looks fine, semantically the paragraph of text and the image are two separate entities. It's just a paragraph of text close to an image.\n\n\n### Lack of proper RSS support\n\nObsidian Publish does generate RSS feeds, e.g. untested.sonnet.io/rss.xml, however the feeds don't contain timestamps, and are (generally) not that useful. See the example feed for potato.horse and untested.sonnet.io in Feedly:\n\n#### Obsidian Publish \n\nBesides lacking pictures and descriptions, none of these links work.\n\n![Obsidian Publish feed in Feedly, missing images, descriptions, and dates](obsidian-publish-feedly.webp)\n\n#### Potato.horse\n![a feed of images and descriptions, with dates](obsidian-potato-horse.webp)\n\n\n### Choosing what content to publish (or not) is hard\n\nMy vault contains a mix of personal, fleeting and public notes:\n\n- Personal: [Say Hi](https://sonnet.io/posts/hi) call logs, morning notes written with Ens≈ç\n- Fleeting notes or unfinished article ideas: the links marked with *todo* you see here\n- Unedited brain farts I will probably remove\n- Published articles, like this one\n\nObsidian Publish has a UI to automatically publish linked resources. For example, I have a note titled [Things to support my own well-being ‚Äì a wishlist](<../Things to support my own well-being ‚Äì a wishlist>). This note links to more detailed project descriptions, but:\n\n1. it's useful on it's own\n2. I'm not ready to publish the linked notes yet\n3. Because of 1 and 2, I'd like to publish it first, then add detail.\n\nWhat happens often is that I click Add Linked and see this:\n\n\n![7898](obsidian-publish-linked-notes-too-many.webp)\n\n\nSo, now I have to scroll through 100s notes to make sure that I'm not including anything I don't want to share or don't want to share *yet*. \n\nTemporary workaround: if you type *something*, literally *anything* in the search box, the UI will display the newly linked notes:\n\n![8224](Pasted%20image%2020231123122223.png)\n\nThis gets a bit unwieldy when you have +1 level of linked notes or you're not 100% sure if 2 of 10 linked notes are ready to be published.

Sure, they can be interesting and give you a peek into another person's mind through a stained glass window, but sometimes they're more fun <em>to tell</em> than to <em>listen to</em>. Having said that, I think there's something to learn here, for one of us at least. Maybe.</p>\n<p>It's Thursday at 6 pm. I'm about to finish my work in one pomodoro. On Slack, I see a colleague talking about a repo with a new project they're working on. It might be cool to work on it in the future so I check out the code and start setting it up. The project is configured via a <code>.env</code> file, so let's:</p>\n<pre><code>$ cd secret-project # that didn't happen\n$ cp example.env .env # that did happen but not where I wanted it to happen\n</code></pre>\n<p>So here's what happened: I was still in a different location, so I removed all of the 30+ environment variables used to get it running. Those include API keys, secrets, plus some esoteric and spicy config vars I do not yet understand. I had no copies of those files, do I have a sane response to why I didn't back them up in the first place.</p>\n<p>Getting them back will take 2-3 hours of my time. It will also waste someones else's time as they'll have to generate the new credentials for me. Yes, this is a stupid and very much avoidable situation.</p>\n<p>And nope, it's not the end of the world, I know. But, I'm an world-class ruminator and this will annoy me till Monday. I don't want that. I'll work on self-improvement and emotional control next week.</p>\n<p>I have 3 terminal windows open, the <code>.env</code> file gone, the variables still in memory. However, if I type <em>any</em> command, <code>direnv</code> will wipe them. So I did what every 0.1x developer would do:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Ask <s>StackOverflow</s> an LLM for ways to dump the env somewhere safe</li>\n<li>Write a script to restore them</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>1. Explain the problem to an LLM and ask for a list of tools letting me read the env vars from memory:</h3>\n<p>Success! I gaze into the latent space, and the latent space gazes back, then whispers in the voice of Scarlet Johansson:</p>\n<p><code>$ printenv &gt; filename # (you dum-dum)</code></p>\n<p>I run the command in each terminal, saving it into a different file (<code>env-recovered.env</code>, <code>old-env</code>, <code>what.env</code>). There is no reason for me to do that 3 times at this stage.

    "rawInput": "![118](env-cover.png)\n\n*Some late night doodles, the punchline is the same as the reason the oopsie mentioned below happened (lost track of time). Title: \"nightmares of the bun man\"*\n\nI don't like war stories. They're a bit like listening to other people's dreams. Sure, they can be interesting and give you a peek into another person's mind through a stained glass window, but sometimes they're more fun *to tell* than to *listen to*. Having said that, I think there's something to learn here, for one of us at least. Maybe.\n\n\nIt's Thursday at 6 pm. I'm about to finish my work in one pomodoro. On Slack, I see a colleague talking about a repo with a new project they're working on. It might be cool to work on it in the future so I check out the code and start setting it up. The project is configured via a `.env` file, so let's:\n\n```\n$ cd secret-project # that didn't happen\n$ cp example.env .env # that did happen but not where I wanted it to happen\n```\n\nSo here's what happened: I was still in a different location, so I removed all of the 30+ environment variables used to get it running. Those include API keys, secrets, plus some esoteric and spicy config vars I do not yet understand. I had no copies of those files, do I have a sane response to why I didn't back them up in the first place. \n\nGetting them back will take 2-3 hours of my time. It will also waste someones else's time as they'll have to generate the new credentials for me. Yes, this is a stupid and very much avoidable situation.\n\nAnd nope, it's not the end of the world, I know. But, I'm an world-class ruminator and this will annoy me till Monday. I don't want that. I'll work on self-improvement and emotional control next week. \n\nI have 3 terminal windows open, the `.env` file gone, the variables still in memory. However, if I type *any* command, `direnv` will wipe them. So I did what every 0.1x developer would do:\n\n1. Ask ~~StackOverflow~~ an LLM for ways to dump the env somewhere safe\n2. Write a script to restore them\n\n### 1\\. Explain the problem to an LLM and ask for a list of tools letting me read the env vars from memory:\n\nSuccess! I gaze into the latent space, and the latent space gazes back, then whispers in the voice of Scarlet Johansson:\n\n`$ printenv > filename # (you dum-dum)`\n\nI run the command in each terminal, saving it into a different file (`env-recovered.env`, `old-env`, `what.env`). There is no reason for me to do that 3 times at this stage. Then, I copy those files into my keychain. \n\nThe result of the `printenv` contains the entire environment of my current shell. I don't want to copy, filter and clean each field one by one. This is one of the rare instances where I'm happy to automate.\n\nSo, I write a quick script in [Quokka](https://quokkajs.com) (a decent REPL for VSCode). It's trivial:\n\n1. get all key names from `example.env`\n2. collect all lines from the restored env dump file \n\t1. return all lines that start with a key mentioned in `example.env`\n3. print out some stats about the env before and after so I can ensure I copied over everything\n\n### Here's the code:\n\n```javascript\nconst recovered = `\nSUPER_SECRET_VAR_0=SUPER_SECRET_CODE \nSUPER_SECRET_VAR_1=SUPER_SECRET_CODE \n# ...\nSUPER_SECRET_VAR_35=SUPER_SECRET_CODE \n  `;\n\nconst fields = `\nSUPER_SECRET_VAR_0= \nSUPER_SECRET_VAR_1= \n# ...\nSUPER_SECRET_VAR_35= \n`;\n\nconst keysToRecover = fields.split(\"\\n\").filter(Boolean);\nconst oldEnvLines = recovered.split(\"\\n\").filter(Boolean);\n\nconst result = keysToRecover\n  .map((key) => {\n    const maybeLine = oldEnvLines.find((l) => l.startsWith(key));\n    if (!maybeLine) console.log(`Missing ${key}`);\n    return maybeLine;\n  })\n  .filter(Boolean);\n\nconst stats = {\n  oldItemsCount: oldEnvLines.length,\n  newItemsCount: result.length,\n  toRecoverCount: keysToRecover.length,\n};\n\nstats; // print the stats variable in the output panel\nresult;\n\nconst resultFILE = result.join(\"\\n\");\nresultFILE; // print the new/recreated env file in the output panel\n\n```\n\nI run the script, copy the values from the output panel and paste them back into my main project. The entire thing took less than 15 minutes. Everything works like charm! I can walk my dog now. \n\n## Key takeaways\n\n- Just backup your `.env` vars you filthy animal\n- If you're looking for a REPL in VSCode, check out Quokka, I've been using it for years (the free version was good enough for me) \n- I could've done this without AI, but search with LLMs is particularly useful when [I don't want to think](<../LLM-powered Tools I'm Actually Using>) about the precise query. I'm not sure if it saved me time, this time, but it was there, and it was one thing less to keep in mind.\n\nThat's all for today! R.\n \n"

This is the dish I'd cook for my first-time visitors.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"/.11ty/image/?src=src%2Fnotes%2Fcacio-e-pepe-temporada.jpg&amp;width=1080&amp;format=jpeg&amp;via=transform\" alt=\"\" width=\"1080\" height=\"810\"><br>\n<em>Feeding people I don't/didn't know with my cacio e pepe and spicy kale crisps, <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/temporada.pt/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">credit</a>.</em></p>\n<p><em>Cacio e pepe</em> means <em>cheese and pepper</em>. Adding black garlic changes this dish quite a bit: it feels meatier, less cheesy and the spiciness of pepper pops out a bit more. I've fed it to a bunch of Italians and at least one chef without gaining any mortal enemies, so you should be fine eating it.</p>\n<p>For 3-4 people, cooking time: 20-40 minutes</p>\n<p>The key to get this dish right is to ensure we get the smooth, silky texture when mixing the starches from pasta water with the cheese. This is a fairly time-sensitive process, so I recommend reading this recipe twice and do as much of the prep work in advance as possible. Good luck!</p>\n<h3>Wine pairing</h3>\n<p>Chianti, Rioja or Primitivo work really well with this dish (peppery/full of tannins is good, sweet, plum jam like not as much). If you live in the UK, check out Campo Viejo Rioja, it's good value and widely available.</p>\n<h2>Ingredients:</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>240-320g of dry, 100% semolina pasta: bucatini (traditional), linguine or spaghetti.</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>Avoid egg pasta. We need something fairly starchy, de Cecco is an easily available, safe choice here.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>120-170g Pecorino Romano or Parmigiano Reggiano</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>The more mature, the better. Parmesan works perfectly fine. Pecorino is the traditional choice. A 50/50 mix of pecorino and parmesan is my favourite.</li>\n<li>Correction from Rafa≈Ç who moved from üá¨üáß ‚Üí üáµüáπ: add S√£o Jorge, just keep the ratio low (&lt;1/5 of all cheese)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Peppercorns ‚Äî ca. 1 tbsp per person + 1 tbsp if you prefer spicier</strong></li>\n<li><strong>1tbsp olive oil</strong></li>\n<li><strong>(Optional) 1tbps of butter, unsalted</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>you might want to control the amount of salt, as we‚Äôll be cooking pasta in a small amount of water in a pan</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Black garlic ‚Äî 1 large clove (or 2 small ones).</strong> Can be found in large Tesco stores, Whole Foods, online or easily made at home (although it takes ages*).</li>\n<li><strong>Salt</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Tools:</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>1 pot or a deep pan (I find it easier to use a 4l pot or something like this)</li>\n<li>1 pan (wide, ideally 5cm deep)</li>\n<li>A slotted spoon or pasta spoon</li>\n<li>A ladle</li>\n<li>Mortar and pestle (alternatively, a meat tenderiser, a tea towel and a career that leaves you with a sense of existential doom)</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Method:</h2>\n<p><strong>Critical steps are in bold</strong>, context and details in regular type.</p>\n<p><strong>Grate the cheese (you might not use all of it).</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Take the black garlic clove and slice it as finely as possible.</strong> Doing so might prove a bit tricky as black garlic tends to have a slightly chocolatey/liquorice-like texture, so don‚Äôt obsess about it too much ‚Äî it‚Äôll melt during cooking. We‚Äôre just trying to speed up this process a bit, as we‚Äôll have to deal with other, time-sensitive tasks simultaneously, later.</p>\n<p><strong>Preheat the pan on high/medium-high heat.

    "rawInput": "I didn't know anyone in London when I moved there, so I decided to meet new people by cooking for them every two weeks. This is the dish I'd cook for my first-time visitors. \n\n![303](cacio-e-pepe-temporada.jpg)\n*Feeding people I don't/didn't know with my cacio e pepe and spicy kale crisps, [credit](https://www.instagram.com/temporada.pt/).*\n\n*Cacio e pepe* means *cheese and pepper*. Adding black garlic changes this dish quite a bit: it feels meatier, less cheesy and the spiciness of pepper pops out a bit more. I've fed it to a bunch of Italians and at least one chef without gaining any mortal enemies, so you should be fine eating it.\n\nFor 3-4 people, cooking time: 20-40 minutes\n\nThe key to get this dish right is to ensure we get the smooth, silky texture when mixing the starches from pasta water with the cheese. This is a fairly time-sensitive process, so I recommend reading this recipe twice and do as much of the prep work in advance as possible. Good luck!\n\n### Wine pairing\n\nChianti, Rioja or Primitivo work really well with this dish (peppery/full of tannins is good, sweet, plum jam like not as much). If you live in the UK, check out Campo Viejo Rioja, it's good value and widely available.\n\n## Ingredients:\n\n- **240-320g of dry, 100% semolina pasta: bucatini (traditional), linguine or spaghetti.**\n\t- Avoid egg pasta. We need something fairly starchy, de Cecco is an easily available, safe choice here.\n- **120-170g Pecorino Romano or Parmigiano Reggiano**\n\t- The more mature, the better. Parmesan works perfectly fine. Pecorino is the traditional choice. A 50/50 mix of pecorino and parmesan is my favourite.\n\t- Correction from Rafa≈Ç who moved from üá¨üáß ‚Üí üáµüáπ: add S√£o Jorge, just keep the ratio low (<1/5 of all cheese)\n- **Peppercorns ‚Äî ca. 1 tbsp per person + 1 tbsp if you prefer spicier**\n- **1tbsp olive oil**\n- **(Optional) 1tbps of butter, unsalted**\n\t- you might want to control the amount of salt, as we‚Äôll be cooking pasta in a small amount of water in a pan\n- **Black garlic ‚Äî 1 large clove (or 2 small ones).** Can be found in large Tesco stores, Whole Foods, online or easily made at home (although it takes ages*).\n- **Salt**\n\n## Tools:\n\n- 1 pot or a deep pan (I find it easier to use a 4l pot or something like this)\n- 1 pan (wide, ideally 5cm deep)\n- A slotted spoon or pasta spoon\n- A ladle\n- Mortar and pestle (alternatively, a meat tenderiser, a tea towel and a career that leaves you with a sense of existential doom)\n\n\n## Method:\n\n**Critical steps are in bold**, context and details in regular type.\n\n\n**Grate the cheese (you might not use all of it).**\n\n**Take the black garlic clove and slice it as finely as possible.** Doing so might prove a bit tricky as black garlic tends to have a slightly chocolatey/liquorice-like texture, so don‚Äôt obsess about it too much ‚Äî it‚Äôll melt during cooking. We‚Äôre just trying to speed up this process a bit, as we‚Äôll have to deal with other, time-sensitive tasks simultaneously, later.\n\n**Preheat the pan on high/medium-high heat. Once the pan is ready, toss in the peppercorns. After 1-2 minutes give them a quick toss.**\nThe point is to increase the temperature evenly and avoid peppercorns burning on one side. We want to: \n- make them release the essential oils and \n- become a tad crunchier and easier to crush.\n\n**After another 1-2 min move the peppercorns to the pestle and crush.** Don't grind them too finely. We don't want dust, but little, slightly crunchy .5mm nuggets of spicy joy.\n\n**Put the pan back on the hob on high heat.** Fill it with water up to 1/2‚Äî3/4 height‚Äîwe need just enough water to cover the pasta, but as little as possible. \nAdd salt‚Äîwe need just enough to make the water taste like seawater (don‚Äôt worry, most of it won‚Äôt get absorbed).\n\n**Once the water starts boiling, lay down the pasta in the pot, spread it evenly on the surface.** Ensure it‚Äôs completely covered so we don‚Äôt get those nasty, sticky, dry bits. \n\n**Cook the pasta for the minimum amount of time specified on the packaging or 1 minute less if preparing this dish for the first time.** This is to avoid overcooking the pasta during the second stage, when we mix everything together.\n\n**Put the 4l pot on the hob and set the heat to medium-high.**\n\n**1-2 minutes before the pasta in the pot is done, add olive oil and peppercorns to the pot.** Leave two, three pinches of crushed peppercorns for decoration.\n\nNow, the important bit:\n\n**Once the pasta is al dente (or ideally, almost al dente), switch off the hob, and start transferring the pasta into the pot. Do. Not. Remove. Pasta. Water.** Try to do it as quickly as possible and occasionally stir the pasta in the pot so it doesn‚Äôt stick. It might get a bit messy (at least it does when I do it).\n\n**Now, once all (or most of the‚Ä¶) pasta is in the pot, start stirring it vigorously. Add butter and black garlic.

Christ, get over this, Dante was younger than you when he was hanging out with Virgil (Midway upon the journey of his life he found himself within a forest dark, for he had strayed from the right path). Dude, I see what you're doing here! Oh come on!\n</details>\n<h3>Why do I do this (or why do I have to fight the urge to do this):</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>because the note I wrote seems too short\n<ul>\n<li>(because I'm worried it'll turn out too short)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>because I'm worried that the note I wrote (or am writing) will sound stupid</li>\n<li>because I'm worried that I don't have much to say or that I'll realise I don't have much to say once I'm done with writing</li>\n<li>because I haven't been writing for some time. Inertia only exacerbates the reasons above.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In short, it's fear. Focussing too much on disclaimers/padding is a form of procrastination and avoidance. Hide the insecurity behind a wall of words. The issue here is that not everyone reading this has a sledgehammer and a taste for afternoon cardio. I want people to know how grateful I feel for everyone who decides to spend their time here. <a href=\"../111\">I don't take it for granted</a>.</p>\n<h3>Valid reasons to add notes with longer intros:</h3>\n<p>To wrap the <a href=\"../Projects%20and%20apps%20I%20built%20for%20my%20own%20well-being\">information in a story</a>, because <a href=\"../Stories%20Help%20Us%20Learn,%20Teach%20and%20Remember\">Stories Help Us Learn, Teach and Remember</a>.</p>\n<p>This is my little shed, not the <a href=\"../Cable%20TV%20Web\">Cable TV Web</a>. I can do as I please. I try to keep it clean and organised, but fluff and mess are perfectly fine, as long as <em>it's my conscious choice</em>, my fluffing fluff.</p>\n<p>When the subject itself seems loaded or controversial, people are likely to come with strong assumptions and I can't find a better way of conveying what I have to say because I lack the skills.</p>\n<p>Sometimes this is a trap: there's no need to please every audience and end up with the lowest common denominator of what to say and how to say it.</p>\n<p>Sometimes it's a signal: perhaps the controversy comes from my own biases, lack of knowledge or prejudice, like a racist starting whatever they have to shit out of their mouth with <em>I'm not racist but...</em></p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"/.11ty/image/?src=src%2Fnotes%2Fcitrus-blind.webp&amp;width=2200&amp;format=webp&amp;via=transform\" alt=\"\" width=\"2200\" height=\"1575\"></p>\n<h3>How I approach this:</h3>\n<p><strong>Keep myself in check.</strong> I track my work using pomodoro, so when I notice that I haven't written anything that <em>directly connects to the title of the note</em> in the past 25 minutes, I ask myself these questions:</p>\n<p>Is this valuable to the person reading this? Is it useful or at least entertaining?</p>\n<p>Am I staying on topic?</p>\n<p>Do I still want to write this? Writing is thinking. I learn and organise my thoughts through writing. Sometimes I realise that the topic seemed interesting, but as soon as the initial excitement wears off, there isn't much left. Padding my words just hides that.</p>\n<p><strong>Cut, paste, replant.</strong> Sometimes a disclaimer or a long intro is more interesting than what I originally set off to write. In this case I move it to a separate note and work on that in a focussed manner. Just working on a different file makes me feel lighter.

    "rawInput": "![146](whatever-fuckit-bird.avif)\n\nDear [Rafa≈Çku](<../Rafa≈Çku>), if you have something to say, say it, don't dilute the information with long intros or disclaimers.\n\n### Why\n\n- it's a waste of time for every party involved\n\n<details>\n<summary>Long... üêç</summary>\nLong disclaimers are the equivalent of your relationship with that one neighbour you see every day but never say hi to them, because you forgot to do it once and now it feels a bit awkward and weirdly, unnecessarily scary. Christ, get over this, Dante was younger than you when he was hanging out with Virgil (Midway upon the journey of his life he found himself within a forest dark, for he had strayed from the right path). Dude, I see what you're doing here! Oh come on!\n</details>\n\n### Why do I do this (or why do I have to fight the urge to do this):\n\n- because the note I wrote seems too short\n\t- (because I'm worried it'll turn out too short)\n- because I'm worried that the note I wrote (or am writing) will sound stupid\n- because I'm worried that I don't have much to say or that I'll realise I don't have much to say once I'm done with writing \n- because I haven't been writing for some time. Inertia only exacerbates the reasons above.\n\nIn short, it's fear. Focussing too much on disclaimers/padding is a form of procrastination and avoidance. Hide the insecurity behind a wall of words. The issue here is that not everyone reading this has a sledgehammer and a taste for afternoon cardio. I want people to know how grateful I feel for everyone who decides to spend their time here. [I don't take it for granted](<../111>). \n\n### Valid reasons to add notes with longer intros:\n\nTo wrap the [information in a story](<../Projects and apps I built for my own well-being>), because [Stories Help Us Learn, Teach and Remember](<../Stories Help Us Learn, Teach and Remember>).\n\nThis is my little shed, not the [Cable TV Web](<../Cable TV Web>). I can do as I please. I try to keep it clean and organised, but fluff and mess are perfectly fine, as long as *it's my conscious choice*, my fluffing fluff.\n\nWhen the subject itself seems loaded or controversial, people are likely to come with strong assumptions and I can't find a better way of conveying what I have to say because I lack the skills.\n\nSometimes this is a trap: there's no need to please every audience and end up with the lowest common denominator of what to say and how to say it.\n\nSometimes it's a signal: perhaps the controversy comes from my own biases, lack of knowledge or prejudice, like a racist starting whatever they have to shit out of their mouth with *I'm not racist but...*\n\n![2688](citrus-blind.webp)\n\n### How I approach this:\n\n**Keep myself in check.** I track my work using pomodoro, so when I notice that I haven't written anything that *directly connects to the title of the note* in the past 25 minutes, I ask myself these questions:\n\nIs this valuable to the person reading this? Is it useful or at least entertaining?\n\nAm I staying on topic?  \n\nDo I still want to write this? Writing is thinking. I learn and organise my thoughts through writing. Sometimes I realise that the topic seemed interesting, but as soon as the initial excitement wears off, there isn't much left. Padding my words just hides that.\n\n**Cut, paste, replant.** Sometimes a disclaimer or a long intro is more interesting than what I originally set off to write. In this case I move it to a separate note and work on that in a focussed manner. Just working on a different file makes me feel lighter. I'd say that more than ¬Ω of the content here was done this way.\n\n**Just remove the disclaimer and learn to live with the discomfort** (related [Kill your darlings, their bones are the best fertiliser](<../Kill your darlings, their bones are the best fertiliser>)). Learning to cull and curate is a skill that takes a tonne of practice. 99/100 times I don't even remember the things I jettisoned. But I do remember the days spent in [Dog mode](<../Dog mode>).\n\nRemind myself that it's ok to leave these notes a bit messy, a bit too wordy [Share your unfinished, scrappy work](<../Share your unfinished, scrappy work>). Every project I try to make perfect is several missed opportunities to make something flawed, but valuable, even if the value comes from the routine.\n\n\n---\n\nBonus: reasons why *commercially-oriented* sites do this:\n\n- to squeeze more ads one the page\n- to prevent Google from scraping their content and serving it before you see it (nowadays, a lost cause, you'll only piss off the users)\n\nYou might find a thread connecting these two issues, let me give you a hint: it's an 11-letter word that starts with A and it rhymes with [Rich People Begging for Money](<../Advertising>).\n"

They're what's called a <em>primitive</em> breed, a bit closer to a wolf in their behaviour than a Labrador (good boys, easy to bribe) or Border Collie (good boys, also best students in class).

    "rawInput": "\n![a bunch of dogs of all shapes and sizes surrouding a confused bear, there's an elf riding a fox](dog-mode.png)\n\nDog mode happens when after a long and successful week (in your opinion at least), instead of feeling tired, you end up overstimulated, unfocused, hyper.\n\nCommon symptoms include: idea diarrhoea, euphoria, a muffled cover or the Doom 3 OST projected from your kundalini chakra towards your head, making it impossible to sit on your ass.\n\nDog mode feels like a superpower. It feels like opening up the console in Quake and typing a cheat code that lets me trigger god mode. But, in reality when in dog mode, I end up more like my dog Mango.\n\nMango is a Podengo, a traditional Portuguese hunting breed. They're what's called a _primitive_ breed, a bit closer to a wolf in their behaviour than a Labrador (good boys, easy to bribe) or Border Collie (good boys, also best students in class). They're relatively hard to train, they're smart, loyal and have a very strong prey drive.\n\nAt home, Mango is the cuddliest, laziest, most loving creature on earth. He'll climb on the couch and rest his snout on my feet when I read or play Outer Worlds. When I‚Äôm sitting on a [zafu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zafu), meditating, he'll approach me as quiet as a church mouse, and get just close enough to lean against my body. Just enough so I can feel his warmth, but not enough for me to need to move. He also loves to sleep.\n\n![a dog on a couch, chill, spreading a bit too much](mango.webp)\n\nSometimes we joke it all feels suspiciously human and we must be living with a tiny, nude middle-aged man. He lives rent free in our flat, dressed in a dog suit. Yes, I wanted you to have this picture in your head. And no, I'm not sorry. Dogs install a virus in your brain that makes you say stuff like this and think, ‚Äúthat's cute‚Äù.\n\nMango seeing \"prey\", however, is a completely different story.

Don't get me wrong, I still wanted to keep <em>working</em> with software but I wanted to <em>study</em> linguistics instead. Nowadays, I rarely get a chance to speak Persian and my skills are deteriorating, but I've never regretted that choice: my world feels bigger than it would've otherwise (YMMV).</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.omniglot.com/images/langsamples/smp_mpersian.gif\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"/.11ty/image/?src=https%3A%2F%2Fexternal-content.duckduckgo.com%2Fiu%2F%3Fu%3Dhttp%253A%252F%252Fwww.omniglot.com%252Fimages%252Flangsamples%252Fsmp_mpersian.gif%26amp%3Bf%3D1%26amp%3Bnofb%3D1%26amp%3Bipt%3Da36764b394b325b53bce62b070f48d777acf067bc307537231ea478f3a0c5683%26amp%3Bipo%3Dimages&amp;width=504&amp;format=gif&amp;via=transform\" alt=\"\" width=\"504\" height=\"171\"></a></p>\n<p>The end result was that I have spent 100s of hours working with manuscripts, mainly written in Middle Persian (or Avestan, a much older language). This also means that I'd become pretty good at absorbing and <em>forgetting</em> new languages very quickly. There's a significant skill overlap between coding, translating manuscripts and speaking with ghosts.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"/.11ty/image/?src=src%2Fnotes%2FPasted%2520image%252020231031162049.png&amp;width=550&amp;format=png&amp;via=transform\" alt=\"\" width=\"550\" height=\"250\"></p>\n<p>One of my favourite things when dealing partially destroyed texts was that every word or stroke told more than one story. For instance, Middle Persian used a version of the Aramaic alphabet (for a variety of fascinating reasons) and was full of ambiguity: one character could become 6 different letters when transcribed, and even more if we take into account possible misspellings, or traces of different writing if the author reused the parchment.</p>\n<p>Honestly, seeing the traces, shadows of people who breathed the same air as I am, but lived in a world where the map was shuffled (from our present, you can say a bit chauvinist, perspective) makes it much harder to feel lonely.</p>\n<p>This is why still I enjoy photographing cemeteries, sneaking into abandoned buildings, sneaking into abandoned internet forums, or <a href=\"https://bluesyncline.gitlab.io/furby/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">reading old code I don't understand</a>.</p>\n<h2>Examples</h2>\n<p>This list is <em>very</em> selective and idiosyncratic (another way of me saying <em>half-assed</em>).

Nowadays, I rarely get a chance to speak Persian and my skills are deteriorating, but I've never regretted that choice: my world feels bigger than it would've otherwise (YMMV).\n\n[![Middle Persian scripts - Pahlavi, Parthian and Psalter](https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.omniglot.com%2Fimages%2Flangsamples%2Fsmp_mpersian.gif&f=1&nofb=1&ipt=a36764b394b325b53bce62b070f48d777acf067bc307537231ea478f3a0c5683&ipo=images)](http://www.omniglot.com/images/langsamples/smp_mpersian.gif)\n\nThe end result was that I have spent 100s of hours working with manuscripts, mainly written in Middle Persian (or Avestan, a much older language). This also means that I'd become pretty good at absorbing and *forgetting* new languages very quickly. There's a significant skill overlap between coding, translating manuscripts and speaking with ghosts.\n\n![1671](Pasted%20image%2020231031162049.png)\n\nOne of my favourite things when dealing partially destroyed texts was that every word or stroke told more than one story. For instance, Middle Persian used a version of the Aramaic alphabet (for a variety of fascinating reasons) and was full of ambiguity: one character could become 6 different letters when transcribed, and even more if we take into account possible misspellings, or traces of different writing if the author reused the parchment.\n\nHonestly, seeing the traces, shadows of people who breathed the same air as I am, but lived in a world where the map was shuffled (from our present, you can say a bit chauvinist, perspective) makes it much harder to feel lonely.\n\nThis is why still I enjoy photographing cemeteries, sneaking into abandoned buildings, sneaking into abandoned internet forums, or [reading old code I don't understand](https://bluesyncline.gitlab.io/furby/index.html).\n\n## Examples\n\nThis list is *very* selective and idiosyncratic (another way of me saying *half-assed*). Fill the gaps with your examples!\n\n### Async:\n\n- Our dog Mango \"reading his newspaper\" every time we walk him.\n- The smell of my partner's perfume after she has left the flat.\n- Notebooks, books and invoices from 1920s left in an abandoned mansion in Vila Nova de Gaia\n  ![2982](3C815C22-55FD-478E-8BC1-A047813C0C20_1_105_c.jpeg)\n- Same place, wine bottles and fingerprints:\n  ![3084](Porto%20I%20(8%20of%2030).jpg)\n- Same place, but 2 years later when someone turned one of the rooms into a chicken pen:\n  ![3202](8D1526D9-959F-4E14-9EC1-27580FA744B1_1_105_c.jpeg)\n- Same place, overgrown, but with lilies still growing in the bushes, which once were a garden big enough to require a hired person to maintain it. I couldn't find the picture of the garden, but here's Luna with a stolen lily \n  ![3486](Porto%20I%20(3%20of%2030).jpg)\n- Old newspapers and gelatinised bottles of wine left in an abandoned house my brothers and I broke into when I was 10.\n- Toilet Graffitis‚Ñ¢ (my next band name)\n- **Black fire pits in the caves in Sassi, Matera.** The town has existed for ca. 2000 years, but the caves on the other side of the canyon, for almost 10000 years! I imagine that those fire pits haven't changed at all since then (definitely not true).\n- This cast of my friend's hand.\n  ![3961](IMG_0041.jpg)\n- **A warm toilet seat.**\n- **The carpet** in the coffee shop near my house, probably resold several times. It looks cheap, a dog scratched it.\n- **Online guestbooks**\n- **Demos of old DOS games** my brothers and I collected as kids from flea markets in Vienna. We didn't have internet, so almost every Sunday we'd go to Liesing and spend our pocket money on scratched game magazine CDs.\n  ![4369](Pasted%20image%2020231031155423.png)\n- **Visiting an old Minecraft house** we built during the pandemic while we still lived in London. Our best friends lived just a few bus stops away, but we couldn't see them in person, so we played almost every day and just hung out there. Luna and I built a little house with chickens, a flower patch and sheep, joking that this would be our house post-apocalypse. We stopped playing regularly after moving out from the UK. Then, a couple of years later, I opened the game and tore up. Time stopped in that place, but we (obviously) moved on and it's hard for me to even compare my life now to who I was then. It sounds silly, I know, but the crafting supplies were still in the same place, the blue sheep were still blue. But I had to \"re-read\" that place, as if it was another abandoned house we visited. I'll find a better way to describe it eventually.\n- **Code like [this](https://bluesyncline.gitlab.io/furby/index.html)**\n\n## Immediate\n\n- Little chirps in [Journey](<../Journey>)\n- Little stars and chirps in  [Sit., together (toy)](https://nothing-together.sonnet.io) (more info [here](<../Sit., (together) devlog 002 ‚Äì Space Kalimba>) [and here](<../Sit., (together)>))\n\n## Ideas for experiments\n\n- Recording all interactions in [Sit., together (toy)](https://nothing-together.sonnet.io) so I can replay them (like a mini-universe with its own stars, black holes and galaxies, a melody of spheres!)\n- A \"palimpsest\" website which contains only a white 1000x1000px rectangle. Every time a new person visits the page, they get to choose a single colour. Then a pixel in that colour is added to the rectangle, starting with the bottom-left corner (0,0). Once the rectangle is filled, we put another rectangle on top of the old one, start from scratch in (0,0) but this time the selected colours will blend with the rectangle underneath.\n  \n\nThanks for reading, see you tomorrow!\n"

Every frame (however often it happens, usually between 30 and 60 fps) we sample the brush and drop it on the screen. This means that in order to draw strokes you'll need to draw more slowly. This means that if you draw really fast you can simulate brush spacing. And, finally, this also means that the brush dynamics will vary slightly between devices, just like it does when I switch from my pastel paper to vellum (or a crappy notebook.)</p>\n<p>I tried to fix it and it looked too pretty.

The code brush is an extension of the regular drawable brush but it's controlled via a tixy.land inspired JS snippet:\n\n```\n(i: int, x: int, y: int) ‚Üí boolean\n```\n\nLet's break this down:\n\n- `i` is the number of the current iteration, increased each frame\n- `x` and `y` are the grid coords\n\n![3411](Pasted%20image%2020240507124018.png)\n\nWe run `ixy` for each pixel of the brush grid, for each iteration. Every time the function returns `true` we draw a pixel, otherwise we leave it empty.\n\n<video playsinline autoplay loop muted src='https://res.cloudinary.com/dlve3inen/video/upload/v1715083361/fig-code-brush-tutorial-random_janugd.mov'/>\n\nSince `i` can be used as a poor man's replacement for *time*, we can use `ixy` to create animated brushes:\n\n<video playsinline autoplay loop muted src='https://res.cloudinary.com/dlve3inen/video/upload/v1715083360/fig-code-brush-tutorial-animation_okbkip.mov'/>\n\nWe can create looped/cyclical animations by using trigonometry, e.g. `Math.sin`.\n\n<video playsinline autoplay loop muted src='https://res.cloudinary.com/dlve3inen/video/upload/v1715083726/fig-oscillation_sjxpoq.mov'/>\n\nI'm often impressed by the work of people who are capable of writing complex shader code. I like to think of this brush editor as a simple, me-sized shader toy. Having said that, let's see if we can hack or break it!\n\n### Prototyping new brushes using ~~aye aye~~ AI\n\ntixy.land caps the number of code characters at 32. We don't have this limitation, but to create more complex behaviours we'll still need:\n\n1. a place to store variables, e.g. computed temporary state\n2. someone with a better knowledge of maths than yours truly\n3. someone who will bother to write the code\n\n1\\. can be solved with IIFEs (immediately-invoked function expressions):\n\n```\n(() => { ... })()\n\n// can be used as:\n\nconst ixy = (i, x, y) => (\n\t() => {\n\t\t// use i, x, y here\n\t\tlet someComputedPropertyUsingXandY = ...\n\t\treturn someOtherComputedProperty\n\t}\n)()\n```\n\n2\\. can be offloaded to Claude!\n\nI'm using some basic prompt vibing‚Ñ¢ tricks here: chain of thought prompting, providing examples.\n\n> None of this song and dance is **really** needed, as providing two examples seemed to be enough to give me useful results: [thread on Xitter](https://twitter.com/rafalpast/status/1771604982598435149/photo/1).\n\n\n#### Here's the prompt:\n(see [My default Coding Assistant System prompt](<../My default Coding Assistant System prompt>) for context)\n\n```\nimplement the function animate (time, x, y) => void\n\nthe function:\n- operates on a grid of 9x9 pixels\n- returns either true or false for each pixel\n- is implemented in Javascript\n\nExample implementations:\n\n- random spray/noise: `return Math.random < 1`\n- diagonal line: `return x === y`\nNow: implement the body of this function that will render a circle (9x9):\n\n- wrap the result in an IIFE and pass these arguments to it: (i, x, y)\n```\n\nResult:\n\n![5961](Pasted%20image%2020240507132505.png)\n\n\n## The woods are lovely dark and deep, so these are the bugs I'd like to keep:\n\n![6080](Pasted%20image%2020240507145004.png)\n\nProcreate is a wonderful piece of software. The faster, messier my brush strokes are, the better they look (thanks for their stabilisation and motion filtering algos). Every line is smooth, dynamic, drawn by a (hand-held) hand. This is useful and valuable as it allows more people to express themselves in ways that were previously impossible or very difficult. I used Procreate and MS Paint as a reference when looking for UX patterns.\n\n> (Yes, nothing can replace patience and discipline when it comes to drawing. I know that because I have low supplies of either.)\n\nFig doesn't even draw lines, which results in a bunch of small glitches. Every frame (however often it happens, usually between 30 and 60 fps) we sample the brush and drop it on the screen. This means that in order to draw strokes you'll need to draw more slowly. This means that if you draw really fast you can simulate brush spacing. And, finally, this also means that the brush dynamics will vary slightly between devices, just like it does when I switch from my pastel paper to vellum (or a crappy notebook.)\n\nI tried to fix it and it looked too pretty. I'm keeping it.\n\nThat's all for today, see you tomorrow!\n"

I'm somewhat less annoyed about this one, but I'm not yet sure why.\n\n## How I use Fig\n\nI play _in_ and _with_ it:\n\n1. I doodle almost every evening\n2. I treat it as a platform for testing smaller toy ideas\n\n1\\. is pretty self-explanatory. It's fun and the results border on trip visuals, but I've noticed that recently using Fig in the evening has replaced my regular drawing sessions. The result is that I have fewer drawings to share. That's probably not a good thing _for me_, but also a fairly isolated problem.\n\n<video muted controls  playsinline src='https://res.cloudinary.com/dlve3inen/video/upload/v1714760659/mango-fig_qbxl4c.mov'/>\n\n2\\. is more interesting, because I'm starting to see how I could break and remix some of parts of Fig into different projects. This brings us to:\n\n## Next steps\n\n<span id=\"^8c282a\" class=\"link-marker\">^8c282a</span>\n\n### Smaller improvements:\n\n- make it mobile friendly. I'm using Fig on my computer and tablet. It works really well with iPad + Apple Pencil, but the UI on mobile is too cluttered.\n- hide the lifespan. When you start the app you're presented with 2 modes:\n  - default: start drawing and control the lifespan of each brush stroke\n  - flow: you don't control the lifespan and you don't know how long the pixels will live for (I'm particularly excited about this one)\n- control the animated gradient fill colours\n\n### Ideas to explore:\n\n#### A simple 3 colour pixel art editor inspired by this drawing:\n\n![7098](ukiyo.png)\n_by [Susan Kare](http://kare.com)_ ([context](https://www.behance.net/gallery/25434317/MacPaint-Ukiyo-e))\n\n#### SSS\n\nA programmable SSS (Simple Silly Shader) graphics editor where both brushes and fill can be controlled using a simple JS snippet.\n\n#### A rhythm-based game\n\nI'm particularly excited about this one, but I'm still looking for a concise way of putting it into words. If you play with the code brushes in Fig, you'll notice that some of them oscillate:\n\n<video muted loop autoplay  playsinline src='https://res.cloudinary.com/dlve3inen/video/upload/v1714764734/fig-oscillation_fpwuvc.mov' />\n\nNow, imagine that this oscillation is synced with music (i.e. the shape and size of the brush follows the beat). Your goal is to trace the lines of a drawing while matching their stroke shape and size. The only way to match it perfectly is to draw in time with the music. In other words - by dancing with your fingers!\n\n![8039](fig-mould.webp)\n\nThat's all for today. See you tomorrow!\n"

Prepare the working space</h2>\n<p>You'll need a flat space, large enough to fit the t-shirt and your tools. I'm lucky to have  a decent drawing desk in my study, but I often use an ironing board for this instead. The plus of an ironing board is that it makes it easier to stretch the fabric a little bit while drawing.</p>\n<h2>3. Select right size in Procreate</h2>\n<p>I trace drawings from my iPad (10.5 inch, 2nd gen) so generally my designs are not bigger than 10-20 cm.</p>\n<p>I like to add markings, similar to <em>crop marks</em> or <em>registration marks</em> used in print. This helps me re-align the drawing with the fabric if something slips or if I need to use my tablet in the meantime.</p>\n<h2>4. Enable guided access</h2>\n<p>Guided access disables most of the touch interactions, ensures the tablet doesn't take a nap while you're drawing and allows you to lock brightness at the highest level. Effectively it turns your tablet into a light tracing box.</p>\n<h2>5. Wrap iPad in cling film to protect it from evil (and marker stains)</h2>\n<p>This is optional, as you should be able to remove the iPad from underneath the fabric once you're done with tracing. I often move straight from tracing to drawing with markers, so I prefer giving it some protection.</p>\n<h2>6. Mount and stretch the fabric</h2>\n<p>Acrylic markers are a pain to wash off and the last thing you want to deal with are creases during drawing. Stretching the fabric will not only make that much less likely, but will also help you achieve more detail and more intense colours once the fibres are relaxed and more tight.</p>\n<p>Use safety pins or heavy rectangular objects like this overpriced mortar and pestle I'm expecting to fall on my head and separate my soul from my body one day:</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"/.11ty/image/?src=src%2Fnotes%2Ftee-tutorial-setup-mortar.webp&amp;width=2000&amp;format=webp&amp;via=transform\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"2666\"></p>\n<h2>6.

The softer the pencil, the better. You can also leave dotted marks with a fine point marker if it's of the same colour as the lines you'll draw in the next step. I'm using a Sakura Pigma brush pen like <a href=\"https://kawaiipenshop.com/products/sakura-pigma-brush-pen\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">this one</a> (I didn't buy it from that site).</p>\n<h2>7.

Let's hold hands. No? OK, fine, that's fine too.</p>\n<center style=\"font-size: 2rem\">‚ùß</center>\n<p>A few months back I was speaking with a startup founder looking for an engineer.  They asked the typical interview question, something along the lines of: \"What do you want to do? What drives you?\". The response I gave them felt honest at the time, but after the call it was followed by a familiar feeling of emptiness, the feeling I get after interviews which seemingly, <em>technically</em> went well. Technically. <em>Technically correct is the best kind of correct</em>, as my fellow 10x developer friend once told me. I'd never speak with them again. I wasn't honest.</p>\n<p>I realised that 3-4 days later, as I was cutting out a picture of a homocercal tail fin and pasting it onto a picture of my dog and listening to some synthwave downloaded from itch.io: I was working on <a href=\"https://meat-gpt.sonnet.io\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Meat GPT</a>. Is this what I want to be doing? I'm fucked. I was born poor and I will die poor.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"/.11ty/image/?src=src%2Fnotes%2F004-fin.png&amp;width=1052&amp;format=png&amp;via=transform\" alt=\"\" width=\"1052\" height=\"865\"><br>\nHomocercal caudal fins are symmetrical (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fish_fin#/media/File:Barb_gonio_080525_9610_ltn_Cf.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">CC</a>)</p>\n<p>The truth is, I felt that even <em>that</em> was more useful than whatever those (arguably much more accomplished and smarter than me) people were doing. When it comes to finding jobs in tech the usefulness of your work is inversely proportional to the salary. The more you get paid, the more useless you are. We, as a species, are screwed.</p>\n<p><strong>Anyway, let's draw a Janusz!</strong></p>\n<p>What's a Janusz you ask? It doesn't matter. And it's pronounced yah-noosh, like baba ganoush.</p>\n<h3>What you'll need:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>something to draw with</li>\n<li>something to draw on</li>\n<li>5 minutes of your time (or as long as you like, the longer, the better)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I'll be using Procreate, since I'm used to it, but pick whatever tools you have at hand. <strong>Don't overthink it.</strong></p>\n<p>1. Draw a circle (or mostly a circle). This will be the head of Janusz. Draw it slightly above the centre of the page. We'll need that space later.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"/.11ty/image/?src=src%2Fnotes%2F004-01.png&amp;width=987&amp;format=png&amp;via=transform\" alt=\"\" width=\"987\" height=\"912\"></p>\n<p>2. Draw 2 arcs coming from the top of the head to the sides. These will mark Janusz's hairline.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"/.11ty/image/?src=src%2Fnotes%2F004-02.png&amp;width=987&amp;format=png&amp;via=transform\" alt=\"\" width=\"987\" height=\"912\"></p>\n<p>Sometimes it helps to visualise two ellipses meeting at the centre and overlapping with the circle forming the head. A <em>Vitruvian</em> Janusz, so to speak:</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"/.11ty/image/?src=src%2Fnotes%2F004-03.png&amp;width=987&amp;format=png&amp;via=transform\" alt=\"\" width=\"987\" height=\"912\"></p>\n<p>3. Did you know that Leonardo named his work after a famous Roman architect? Now fill the spaces to give Janusz a healthy dark hairline.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"/.11ty/image/?src=src%2Fnotes%2F004-04.png&amp;width=987&amp;format=png&amp;via=transform\" alt=\"\" width=\"987\" height=\"912\"></p>\n<p>4. Perfect. I like to plump it up a little bit at the top:</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"/.11ty/image/?src=src%2Fnotes%2F004-05.png&amp;width=987&amp;format=png&amp;via=transform\" alt=\"\" width=\"987\" height=\"912\"></p>\n<p>5. Time for the eyes. Note that the pupils are slightly elongated, a bit like in the drawings by <a href=\"https://i.cbc.ca/1.4270907.1504213418!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/jon-klassen.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Jon Klassen</a>. Janusz's eyes are deep and dark like the Silesian coal mines. If you stare into them for too long you'll feel what French call <em>l‚Äôappel du vide</em>. I warned you.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"/.11ty/image/?src=src%2Fnotes%2F004-06.png&amp;width=987&amp;format=png&amp;via=transform\" alt=\"\" width=\"987\" height=\"912\"></p>\n<p>6. Time for the lips and the nose. Don't worry about getting his nose perfect. Perfect noses lack character.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"/.11ty/image/?src=src%2Fnotes%2F004-07.png&amp;width=987&amp;format=png&amp;via=transform\" alt=\"\" width=\"987\" height=\"912\"></p>\n<p>7. Now let's give him a chin.</p>\n<p>The dimple reminds me of a radio presenter who used to keep me company during the nights when I had to work, following afternoons I spent studying for exams. His biography is titled: <em>How I didn't become a saxophonist</em>.</p>\n<p>Who is your favourite owner of a dimple? Do they play any instruments?</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"/.11ty/image/?src=src%2Fnotes%2F004-08.png&amp;width=987&amp;format=png&amp;via=transform\" alt=\"\" width=\"987\" height=\"912\"></p>\n<p>8. We're almost there! Now, draw a big <strong>6+</strong> in the top right corner, ideally using a different colour. Red or green is suitable for Janusz at this time of the year. You can add a smiley face at the bottom.</p>\n<p>Why 6+ and why a smiley face? Because Poland uses a numeric scale for grades: 5 is the equivalent of an A, 6+ is an out of bounds <code>Exception</code>. And Janusz <em>is</em> exceptional.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"/.11ty/image/?src=src%2Fnotes%2F004-09.png&amp;width=987&amp;format=png&amp;via=transform\" alt=\"\" width=\"987\" height=\"912\"></p>\n<p>9.

    "rawInput": "\nI'm not completely sure where I'm going with this, but stay with me, ok? Let's hold hands. No? OK, fine, that's fine too.\n\n<center style='font-size: 2rem'>‚ùß</center>\n\nA few months back I was speaking with a startup founder looking for an engineer.  They asked the typical interview question, something along the lines of: \"What do you want to do? What drives you?\". The response I gave them felt honest at the time, but after the call it was followed by a familiar feeling of emptiness, the feeling I get after interviews which seemingly, *technically* went well. Technically. *Technically correct is the best kind of correct*, as my fellow 10x developer friend once told me. I'd never speak with them again. I wasn't honest.\n\nI realised that 3-4 days later, as I was cutting out a picture of a homocercal tail fin and pasting it onto a picture of my dog and listening to some synthwave downloaded from itch.io: I was working on [Meat GPT](https://meat-gpt.sonnet.io). Is this what I want to be doing? I'm fucked. I was born poor and I will die poor.\n\n\n![Homocercal caudal fin](004-fin.png)\nHomocercal caudal fins are symmetrical ([CC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fish_fin#/media/File:Barb_gonio_080525_9610_ltn_Cf.jpg))\n\n\nThe truth is, I felt that even *that* was more useful than whatever those (arguably much more accomplished and smarter than me) people were doing. When it comes to finding jobs in tech the usefulness of your work is inversely proportional to the salary. The more you get paid, the more useless you are. We, as a species, are screwed.\n\n**Anyway, let's draw a Janusz!**\n\nWhat's a Janusz you ask? It doesn't matter. And it's pronounced yah-noosh, like baba ganoush.\n\n### What you'll need:\n\n- something to draw with\n- something to draw on\n- 5 minutes of your time (or as long as you like, the longer, the better)\n\nI'll be using Procreate, since I'm used to it, but pick whatever tools you have at hand. **Don't overthink it.**\n\n\n1\\. Draw a circle (or mostly a circle). This will be the head of Janusz. Draw it slightly above the centre of the page. We'll need that space later.\n\n![a circle](004-01.png)\n\n2\\. Draw 2 arcs coming from the top of the head to the sides. These will mark Janusz's hairline.\n \n![a circle with a hairline](004-02.png)  \n\nSometimes it helps to visualise two ellipses meeting at the centre and overlapping with the circle forming the head. A *Vitruvian* Janusz, so to speak:\n\n![a circle with a hairline and a bunch of visual guidelines, angles marked with Greek letters](004-03.png)\n\n3\\. Did you know that Leonardo named his work after a famous Roman architect? Now fill the spaces to give Janusz a healthy dark hairline.\n\n![a circle with a hairline, the hair is black](004-04.png)\n\n4\\. Perfect. I like to plump it up a little bit at the top:\n\n![a circle with a hairline, the hair is black and puffy at the top](004-05.png)\n\n5\\. Time for the eyes. Note that the pupils are slightly elongated, a bit like in the drawings by [Jon Klassen](https://i.cbc.ca/1.4270907.1504213418!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/jon-klassen.jpg). Janusz's eyes are deep and dark like the Silesian coal mines. If you stare into them for too long you'll feel what French call _l‚Äôappel du vide_. I warned you.\n\n![a circle with a hairline, the hair is black and puffy at the top. Big black eyes.](004-06.png)\n\n6\\. Time for the lips and the nose. Don't worry about getting his nose perfect. Perfect noses lack character.\n\n![a circle with a hairline, the hair is black and puffy at the top. big black eyes, little nose, and a semi-smile](004-07.png)\n\n7\\. Now let's give him a chin.\n\nThe dimple reminds me of a radio presenter who used to keep me company during the nights when I had to work, following afternoons I spent studying for exams. His biography is titled: *How I didn't become a saxophonist*.\n   \nWho is your favourite owner of a dimple? Do they play any instruments?\n\n![a circle with a hairline, the hair is black and puffy at the top, cleft chin, big dimple. it's a face!](004-08.png)\n\n8\\. We're almost there! Now, draw a big **6+** in the top right corner, ideally using a different colour. Red or green is suitable for Janusz at this time of the year. You can add a smiley face at the bottom. \n\nWhy 6+ and why a smiley face? Because Poland uses a numeric scale for grades: 5 is the equivalent of an A, 6+ is an out of bounds `Exception`. And Janusz *is* exceptional.\n\n![a circle with a hairline, the hair is black and puffy at the top, cleft chin, big dimple. a grade (6+)](004-09.png)\n\n9\\. Finally, take your drawing and use the empty space we saved up for later to write these words: I cherish you `<insert your name here>`. Janusz thinks you're great. Because *you* **made** him. And you know what? You are great. You're fantastic.\n\n![a circle with a hairline, the hair is black and puffy at the top, cleft chin, big dimple. there's a label below, it says \"I cherish you, Rafal\"](004-10.png)\n\nDrawing helps me get out of my head. I hope that next time you need to get out of yours, it'll get a bit easier.\n\n\nHugs.\nR.\n\n- PS. Share your Janusz with me!

Give me 5*.  \n\t\t- *Give me 3 most common patterns of handling async and their pros and cons.*\n\t- automate boring, repetitive work via bash scripts, examples:\n\t\t- one of my clients has a fairly elaborate process involving jumping between task tracking, Slack, GH PRs etc... I used to find this super distracting. So now, I just have a single *new-task.sh* file doing that for me. \n\t\t- a script that checks my calendar and calculates billable hours\n\t\t- writing tmux, neovim, alacritty configs (i.e. the stuff that I don't need to keep in my working memory)\n\t- CLI documentation, e.g.:\n\t\t- `vv how to do X in ffmpeg?`\n\t\t- `vv how to create a new issue in GH CLI`\n\t\t- Note the `vv` prefix . My LLM is configured to reply with code only when it's present.\n\t- vim tutor\n\t\t- `vv replace every instance of foo with bar in neovim, where xxx`\n- (via voice) wikipedia rabbit holes, creating *mini-podcasts* for myself where I can ask the LLM to, say, *give me a quick overview of the history of Nigeria* or explain the gotchas when moving from JS to Python.\n- **Writing:**\n\t- looking up more idiomatic, common phrases (how would a native speaker say x?)\n\t- finding the word on the tip of my tongue (99% of it's *I FORGOT AGAIN, oh my god*)\n\t\t- edit: *inertia*, fuck! Why?\n\t- thesaurus, e.g. *what's the difference between flotsam and jetsam?*\n\t- **I never use it to generate longer pieces of text. I see it mostly as an editor I can ask questions about my work.**  Besides sharing, I enjoy *learning and thinking through writing*. I'm not worried that by handing over more of my work to LLMs I'll end up generating AI slop. I just don't see the point of taking away the pleasure.\n- Quick translation, esp. when I want to find the most idiomatic way of saying something quickly, e.g. *Translate into <Brazilian|continental> Portuguese: Do you have fine-grade sandpaper?*. This is also useful because it helps me with:\n- **Language learning:**\n\t- e.g. *conjugate 10 most common irregular verbs in continental Portuguese, later turn them into Anki flashcards, following this format `...`*\n\t- I'm looking forward to play with GPT-4o as a poor man's language tutor focussed on spoken language\n- summarisation, mainly of academic papers so I can prioritise what to read first. I also use it to query papers, find alternative theories (w. sources), follow-up reading lists\n\t- Also, summarising and finding issues with Privacy Policies when I'm vetting a product\n- manuals\n- identify artwork, e.g. *This wood carving depicts a scene from Hindu mythology, identify it and describe under 100 words* (then follow up with Wikipedia)\n- Movie recommendations based on samples\n\nI use their desktop and mobile app.\n\nThe main strength of Chat GPT lies in its UX. Otherwise, I'd be happy to switch to Claude.\n\nI also used their 3rd-party clients (like Machato) and even wrote a simple client for [Dall-e](https://sonnet.io/projects#:~:text=Dall%2De%20UI%20Cheap%20Bastard%20Edition%E2%84%A2) long time ago.\n\n### How often\n\n- several times per day\n\n## Claude Opus (via the console)\n\n### How I use it\n\n- All of the coding related tasks mentioned with Chat GPT. Claude is much better in my experience, but the console UX is not as good as the Chat GPT native client.\n\t- I use it sometimes to generate brushes for [Fig](https://fig.sonnet.io) \n\n### How often\n\n- rarely (several times per week until the Chat GPT 4o became available in the native client)\n\n## ollama w. dolphin-mistral, LLaMa, LLaVa\n\n### How I use it\n\n- for anything mentioned above but *offline*\n- for anything mentioned above but *without censorship*\n\t- LLMs often panic when I ask them to compare passages of text in different religious texts (e.g. Avesta and the Old Testament or Quran). Sorry, nothing naughty to see here.\n- offline replacement for google, e.g. *who was Dante hanging out with at the beginning of Comedy?*\n- little experiments like [Summarise My Weekly Notes (With Llamas)](<../Summarise My Weekly Notes (With Llamas)>)\n\t- Ilamafile is also pretty good. ollama is just there, always one `ollama run` away from running and testing a new model\n\n### How often\n\n- every few weeks, mainly during travel (I keep surprising myself how well it works)\n\n\n## Summary\n\nI use LLMs for *search*. It's search where I *control the shape of the input and the format of the output.*  <span id=\"^6ef7b9\" class=\"link-marker\">^6ef7b9</span>\n\nFor instance, instead of going through the docs of `colander` (a python schema library), reading up problems and examples on SO, I can just ask it to provide me with sample implementations of a generalised version of a problem. This saves me a ton of time, but also means that I need to know what questions to ask, and how. None of this can replace reasoning, critical thinking and experience.\n\nWhat I've learned and realised writing this:\n\n- I underestimated how much convenience impacts my work. The main value of OpenAI products for me is convenience. This won't last long.\n- I overestimated the usefulness of Copilot. I don't need it. I need a better, dumber, private autocomplete that can match my coding patterns. \n\t- I just saved $10 per month! (is there an alternative, ideally an OSS project I can donate to instead of Github? [Let me know](mailto:hello@sonnet.io).)\n\n\nThat's all for today. See you tomorrow!\n"

The process boils down to 4 steps:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>desaturate the base image</li>\n<li>apply the noise</li>\n<li>reduce the number of colours to 3-5 steps (e.g. using <em>posterize</em>)</li>\n<li>apply a gradient mask</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I prefer learning by playing, tweaking, and breaking things. So I added a bit of UI to control different parts of the effect, in case you're similar to me in that regard:</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"/.11ty/image/?src=src%2Fnotes%2Finnocent-gradient-fun-bela.webp&amp;width=1336&amp;format=webp&amp;via=transform\" alt=\"\" width=\"1336\" height=\"710\"></p>\n<h3>How it works in HTML + CSS</h3>\n<p>If you're interested in a longer write-up, <a href=\"mailto:hello@sonnet.io\">let me know</a>. Today, we're <a href=\"../Half-ass%20it\">half-assing</a> things.</p>\n<p>In short, the image is wrapped in a bunch of HTML elements called <em>Layers</em>. Each <em>Layer</em> has a <code>filter: url(#some-svg-filter)</code> applied to it.

    "rawInput": "Hi there! This one will be quick. Let's let the code speak for itself for a change.\n\n![211](innocent-gradient-fun.webp)\n\nA week back or so I saw a [video by a channel called Texture Labs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1poWgZWpsiY&t=22s) explaining a simple shading technique using gradients, grain and posterise. I thought it would be a fun thing to play with, so here you go. [Just Some Innocent Gradient Fun](https://grain.potato.horse) is a simple graphics editor demonstrating the technique mentioned in the video.\n\n\n> [!NOTE] **Check it out [here](https://grain.potato.horse/).**\n\n<marquee style='font-family: cursive; font-size: 2em'>\nor <a href='//grain.potato.horse' target='_blank'>heeere</a> \n</marquee>\n\n### How it works:\n\nThe video does a pretty good job explaining the effect itself, so I recommend watching it out for more context. The process boils down to 4 steps:\n\n1. desaturate the base image\n2. apply the noise\n3. reduce the number of colours to 3-5 steps (e.g. using *posterize*)\n4. apply a gradient mask\n\nI prefer learning by playing, tweaking, and breaking things. So I added a bit of UI to control different parts of the effect, in case you're similar to me in that regard:\n\n![1323](innocent-gradient-fun-bela.webp)\n\n### How it works in HTML + CSS\n\nIf you're interested in a longer write-up, [let me know](mailto:hello@sonnet.io). Today, we're [half-assing](<../Half-ass it>) things. \n\nIn short, the image is wrapped in a bunch of HTML elements called *Layers*. Each *Layer* has a `filter: url(#some-svg-filter)` applied to it. Those `#some-svg-filter` IDs point to an invisible SVG element with SVG filter definitions. \n\n```html\n  <div\n\tclassName={styles.layer}\n\tstyle={ { filter: 'url(\"#posterize\")' } }\n>\n\t<img ...>\n```\n\n\n```jsx\n  <svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" version=\"1.1\" style=\"display: none;\">\n    <defs>\n      <filter id=\"posterize\">\n        <feComponentTransfer>\n          <feFuncR type=\"discrete\" tableValues={posterSteps} />\n          <feFuncG type=\"discrete\" tableValues={posterSteps} />\n          <feFuncB type=\"discrete\" tableValues={posterSteps} />\n        </feComponentTransfer>\n      </filter>\n    ...\n    </defs>\n </svg>\n```\n\nIn a real world scenario, you could do just fine with 1-2 DOM elements because CSS filters can be stacked. I kept them separate to make the code easier to read and mess with.\n\n### What I've learned: \n\n[Just Some Innocent Gradient Fun/SVG filter quirks](<../Just Some Innocent Gradient Fun/SVG filter quirks>)\n\n### Next steps:\n\nNot much. This was fun to play with, but I'm trying to me more selective with my time since I have more important things to wrap up this year (like the next version of [Ens≈ç](https://enso.sonnet.io)!)\n\nOK, there's one tempting idea: creating a web component that wraps an image element to render it in the style of [Return of the Obra Dinn](https://store.steampowered.com/app/653530/Return_of_the_Obra_Dinn/) or applies a dithering effect like some of the bio entries on this site ([Wislawa Szymborska](<../Wislawa Szymborska>), [Zygmunt Bauman](<../Zygmunt Bauman>)).\n\n### Why I made it:\n\n1. [Share your unfinished, scrappy work](<../Share your unfinished, scrappy work>)\n2. [Dog mode](<../Dog mode>)\n3. [Why make toys, why play?](<../Why make toys, why play?>)\n\n\n(I needed to get out of a rut, and sometimes making useless things helps me get back on track.)\n\nThanks for reading, see you tomorrow!\n\n![3345](innocent-gradient-fun.png)\n\n"

In our case, we're not rendering any <em>precise</em> 3d shapes. Effectively, we're just projecting a noise texture on the screen. This means that we can keep this value as low as possible to reduce battery impact of the animation. Here's the same code rendered with <code>setMaxIterations(1);</code> and <code>setMaxIterations(1000);</code>:</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"/.11ty/image/?src=src%2Fnotes%2Fmidnight-shader-iterations.webp&amp;width=1360&amp;format=webp&amp;via=transform\" alt=\"\" width=\"1360\" height=\"1242\"></p>\n<p>Let's move on to the noise itself. Shader Park uses simplex noise, which generates values between -1 and 1:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">let noiseScale = 1.0;\nlet timeScale = 0.1;\nlet s = getSpace();\nlet n = 0.5 * noise(noiseScale * s + time * timeScale) + 0.5;\n</code></pre>\n<p>In order to calculate colours we sample a simplex noise value based on:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>the coordinate space (<code>getSpace</code>)</li>\n<li><code>time</code></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Using time as a parameter allows us to animate the noise and maintain continuity.</p>\n<p><code>timeScale</code> allows us to control how quickly the animation progresses.<br>\n<code>noiseScale</code> controls the 'roughness' of the noise. To put it simply, if we zoom in very close, simplex noise will look a bit like a series of clouds with some structure, if we zoom out, the noise will feel more random:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">let n2 = 0.5 * noise(noiseScale * s + time * timeScale + n * 1.5) + 0.5;\n\t//                                                    !!! ‚§¥ \n</code></pre>\n<p>Here's a neat trick: we can make the texture more complex and create \"creases\" in the fabric by computing a noise with the previous noise <code>n</code> as one of the parameters.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"/.11ty/image/?src=src%2Fnotes%2Fmidnight-shader-multiple-noises.webp&amp;width=1400&amp;format=webp&amp;via=transform\" alt=\"\" width=\"1400\" height=\"606\"></p>\n<p>Finally, let's turn that noise into colours we can render on the screen. I've split the colour calculation code into smaller steps. Also, it'll make more sense to read them backwards!</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">let c = clamp( // 3.\n\t0,\n\t20,\n\tpow(n2, 8) * 290 // 2.\n);\n\ncolor(c, c, c); // 1.\n</code></pre>\n<p>1. <code>c</code> is the computed colour.</p>\n<p><code>color</code>  accepts RGB values between 0 and 1, so <code>1,0,0</code> = red, <code>1,1,1</code> = white, <code>0,0,0</code> = black. So, by saying <code>color(val, val, val)</code> we're just generating a grey pixel with <code>val</code> as the level of brightness.</p>\n<p>2. we take the colour value from our noise to the power of 8 (<code>pow(a,b)</code>) and multiply it by 290 (a magic number).</p>\n<p>Why these numbers? The short answer: trial and error, laziness and my adventurous, devil-may-care attitude. The slightly longer answer: <code>pow</code> is just a quick and dirty way of increasing the contrast towards the darker noise values (<em>0.2 √ó 0.2 = 0.04</em> but 0.9 √ó 0.9 = .81). The resulting numbers will be <strong>very</strong> low, so we multiply them by this high magic number. The number is high enough to make the shades look good without introducing colour clipping.</p>\n<p>This is not the ideal solution and I'd go with a <a href=\"../Sigmoid%20function\">Sigmoid function</a> or trigonometry to have more control over the contrast.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"/.11ty/image/?src=src%2Fnotes%2Fmaude-lebowski.jpeg&amp;width=620&amp;format=jpeg&amp;via=transform\" alt=\"\" width=\"620\" height=\"400\"></p>\n<p><em>Does the sound of a sigmoid function make you uncomfortable Mr Lebowski? Well, my art has been commented as strongly hacky, which bothers some 10x engineers, the word sss..sigmoid itself makes some 10x engineers uncomfortable.</em></p>\n<p>3. We're using clamp to keep the value between 0 and 20 for each point.<br>\nEarlier I said that colour channels take values between 0 and 1, so 1 should mean white, right? So what's the point of allowing for values higher than 1? The simple answer is that we're still are rendering the noise within a lit 3d space. This means that a white cube is not perfectly white, but slightly shaded. And that's important because we're using the multiply blend mode: any non-white colour would darken the background.</p>\n<p>%% image multiply %%</p>\n<p>Now, the final step:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">sphere(0.5);\n</code></pre>\n<p>Just allows us to render the texture on the screen. The shape doesn't matter since the number of iteration steps is so low.</p>\n<h2>Alternative approaches:</h2>\n<h4>Render a series of animated conic gradients.</h4>\n<ol>\n<li>Render 2-3 conic gradients and rotate them</li>\n<li>Ensure that each of the animation durations are distinct prime numbers</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Pros:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>no library needed</li>\n<li>almost no file size impact</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Cons:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>takes some effort to look good</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Render a series of animated circular gradients.</h4>\n<ol>\n<li>Render 2-3 circular gradients and make them orbit</li>\n<li>Ensure that each orbit has duration specified using a prime number</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Pros:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>same as above</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Cons:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>same as above</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Use SVG filters</p>\n<p>This approach is similar to the animated circular gradients, but with SVG circles and a blur filter to achieve the same effect.</p>\n<p>Pros:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>simple to implement</li>\n<li>no file size impact</li>\n<li>no dependencies</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Cons:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>noticeable performance drop on older devices</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Use an image file instead:</p>\n<p>The image is a tiled noise texture with animated background position.</p>\n<p>Pros:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>simple</li>\n<li>no dependencies</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Cons:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>the animation is pre-baked, so it can't be controlled programmatically</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Use Canvas + a noise library instead of shaders:</p>\n<p>In this approach we use a noise library (can be pulled from p5.js) and render a simple noise on canvas.</p>\n<p>Pros:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>almost no dependencies</li>\n<li>relatively easy</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Cons:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>I wanted to learn something new</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Summary:</p>\n<p>I like how this looks.

([Shader Park is Kinda Neat](<../Shader Park is Kinda Neat>))\n\nHere's the complete ShaderPark code:\n\n```javascript\nsetMaxIterations(1);\nbackgroundColor(1, 1, 1);\n\nlet noiseScale = 1.0;\nlet timeScale = 0.1;\nlet s = getSpace();\n\nlet n = 0.5 * noise(noiseScale * s + time * timeScale) + 0.5;\nlet n2 = 0.5 * noise(noiseScale * s + time * timeScale + n * 1.5) + 0.5;\n\nlet c = clamp(0, 20, pow(n2, 8) * 290);\n\ncolor(c, c, c);\n\nsphere(0.5);\n\n```\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n```js\nsetMaxIterations(1);\n```\n\n`setMaxIterations` reduces the number of iterations of the SDF algorithm. In our case, we're not rendering any *precise* 3d shapes. Effectively, we're just projecting a noise texture on the screen. This means that we can keep this value as low as possible to reduce battery impact of the animation. Here's the same code rendered with `setMaxIterations(1);` and `setMaxIterations(1000);`:\n\n![3466](midnight-shader-iterations.webp)\n\nLet's move on to the noise itself. Shader Park uses simplex noise, which generates values between -1 and 1:\n\n```js\nlet noiseScale = 1.0;\nlet timeScale = 0.1;\nlet s = getSpace();\nlet n = 0.5 * noise(noiseScale * s + time * timeScale) + 0.5;\n```\n\nIn order to calculate colours we sample a simplex noise value based on: \n- the coordinate space (`getSpace`)\n- `time`\n\nUsing time as a parameter allows us to animate the noise and maintain continuity.\n\n`timeScale` allows us to control how quickly the animation progresses.\n`noiseScale` controls the 'roughness' of the noise. To put it simply, if we zoom in very close, simplex noise will look a bit like a series of clouds with some structure, if we zoom out, the noise will feel more random:\n\n\n```js\nlet n2 = 0.5 * noise(noiseScale * s + time * timeScale + n * 1.5) + 0.5;\n\t//                                                    !!! ‚§¥ \n```\n\nHere's a neat trick: we can make the texture more complex and create \"creases\" in the fabric by computing a noise with the previous noise `n` as one of the parameters.\n\n![4559](midnight-shader-multiple-noises.webp)\n\nFinally, let's turn that noise into colours we can render on the screen. I've split the colour calculation code into smaller steps. Also, it'll make more sense to read them backwards!\n\n```js\nlet c = clamp( // 3.\n\t0,\n\t20,\n\tpow(n2, 8) * 290 // 2.\n);\n\ncolor(c, c, c); // 1.\n```\n\n1\\. `c` is the computed colour. \n\n`color`  accepts RGB values between 0 and 1, so `1,0,0` = red, `1,1,1` = white, `0,0,0` = black. So, by saying `color(val, val, val)` we're just generating a grey pixel with `val` as the level of brightness.\n\n2\\. we take the colour value from our noise to the power of 8 (`pow(a,b)`) and multiply it by 290 (a magic number).\n\nWhy these numbers? The short answer: trial and error, laziness and my adventurous, devil-may-care attitude. The slightly longer answer: `pow` is just a quick and dirty way of increasing the contrast towards the darker noise values (*0.2 √ó 0.2 = 0.04* but 0.9 √ó 0.9 = .81). The resulting numbers will be **very** low, so we multiply them by this high magic number. The number is high enough to make the shades look good without introducing colour clipping.\n\nThis is not the ideal solution and I'd go with a [Sigmoid function](<../Sigmoid function>) or trigonometry to have more control over the contrast.\n\n![5822](maude-lebowski.jpeg)\n\n*Does the sound of a sigmoid function make you uncomfortable Mr Lebowski? Well, my art has been commented as strongly hacky, which bothers some 10x engineers, the word sss..sigmoid itself makes some 10x engineers uncomfortable.* \n\n3\\. We're using clamp to keep the value between 0 and 20 for each point. \nEarlier I said that colour channels take values between 0 and 1, so 1 should mean white, right? So what's the point of allowing for values higher than 1? The simple answer is that we're still are rendering the noise within a lit 3d space. This means that a white cube is not perfectly white, but slightly shaded. And that's important because we're using the multiply blend mode: any non-white colour would darken the background.\n\n%% image multiply %%\n\nNow, the final step:\n\n```js\nsphere(0.5);\n```\n\nJust allows us to render the texture on the screen. The shape doesn't matter since the number of iteration steps is so low.\n\n## Alternative approaches:\n\n#### Render a series of animated conic gradients.\n\n1. Render 2-3 conic gradients and rotate them\n2. Ensure that each of the animation durations are distinct prime numbers\n\nPros:\n- no library needed\n- almost no file size impact\n\nCons: \n- takes some effort to look good\n\n#### Render a series of animated circular gradients.\n\n1. Render 2-3 circular gradients and make them orbit\n2. Ensure that each orbit has duration specified using a prime number\n\nPros:\n- same as above\n\nCons: \n- same as above\n\nUse SVG filters\n\nThis approach is similar to the animated circular gradients, but with SVG circles and a blur filter to achieve the same effect.\n\nPros: \n- simple to implement\n- no file size impact\n- no dependencies\n\nCons: \n- noticeable performance drop on older devices\n\n\nUse an image file instead:\n\nThe image is a tiled noise texture with animated background position.\n\nPros:\n\n- simple\n- no dependencies\n\nCons:\n\n- the animation is pre-baked, so it can't be controlled programmatically\n\n\nUse Canvas + a noise library instead of shaders:\n\nIn this approach we use a noise library (can be pulled from p5.js) and render a simple noise on canvas.\n\nPros:\n\n- almost no dependencies\n- relatively easy\n\nCons:\n\n- I wanted to learn something new\n\n\nSummary:\n\nI like how this looks. I'm not sure if it's worth adding to the main site.\n[What do you think](mailto:hello@sonnet.io)?\n\n"

This means that a screen displaying a black rectangle will emit no light. \n\nWhy red? I'm using red since our eyes are much less sensitive towards it than to green. \n\nIt is true that we have even fewer cones (photoreceptor cells responsible for colour vision) detecting blue light, but isolated blue light can become fuzzy due to chromatic aberration. My understanding is that our eyes are not even able to focus on blue light alone. \n\nI also like the way red looks. \n\n## How did I make it?\n\n![a black rectangle](black-rectangle.png)\n*(me working on nightnight)*\n\n\nFirst, I wanted to get this done in 2 pomodoros, so needed to make some compromises.

Thus ending up with thousands of people LARPing becoming art promoters in the most cringe-inducing way possible: trying to play Minecraft in meatspace.\n"

Twenty years later, I've visited dozens of necropolises across Europe, Africa and South East Asia and, more importantly, I somehow turned a fear into a source of calmness.

It's inspired by processing / p5.js, and provides a series of functions that make it much easier to use than working with plain GLSL code.</p>\n<p>The project is still fairly new and rough around the edges, but it's so much fun to work with! I had to exercise a lot of willpower to stick to writing this note, as I kept coming back to it and sketching little animations.</p>\n<p>In that sense it reminds me a bit of <a href=\"https://tixy.land\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">tixy</a>: it <em>feels</em> like a toy but can spit out something that looks really cool even with minimal effort. For instance, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sz2mmM-kN1I\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">look at this blob</a>:</p>\n<iframe src=\"https://shaderpark.com/embed/-Nl4jm_zJfCuBt4t2C9J\" frameborder=\"0\" style=\"aspect-ratio:4/3\"></iframe>\n<p>This is the code required to generate it:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">let scale = 2.0;\nlet s = getSpace();\nlet n = 0.2 * noise(scale * s + time); \n\t// generate a noise value based on the space coords, scale, \n\t// and time (to create an animation)\n\t\ncolor(1,.3,.7) // set the color in rgb space (0...1)\n\nsphere(0.7 + n); // draw a sphere by adding noise to each point\n</code></pre>\n<p>And here's an even simpler example:</p>\n<iframe src=\"https://shaderpark.com/embed/-Nl4oPqg6gBLRIIlq8s1\" frameborder=\"0\" style=\"aspect-ratio: 4/3\"></iframe>\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">// move coords\ndisplace(0, -.45, 0) \n\n// enable shape blending\nblend(.5)    \n\n// set the color to red        \ncolor(1,0,0) \n\n// draw a small box\nbox(0.6, .1, .3) \n\n// move coords\ndisplace(0, .9, 0) \n\n// draw another small sphere in the same coords\nsphere(0.5 + sin(time) * .2) \n</code></pre>\n<p><em>Ignore the <code>sin(time)</code> bit for now. We're using it to create a looped animation. More on that next week (<a href=\"../Midnight%20Shader\">Midnight Shader</a>).</em></p>\n<p>So, how does this work?</p>\n<h2>Signed Distance Field (SDF)</h2>\n<p>Instead of meshes and polygons Shader Park relies on an algorithm called Signed Distance Fields.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.alanzucconi.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Alan Zucconi</a> compares vertex based rendering and SDF to pixels and SVG: all vertex meshes representing curved shapes are just approximations. SDF represents entire shapes as mathematical functions, thus allowing for a much higher level of detail, whereas a 3D mesh will have a finite level of detail depending on its  polygon count.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"/.11ty/image/?src=src%2Fnotes%2Fsdf-vs-polygons-janusz.webp&amp;width=1200&amp;format=webp&amp;via=transform\" alt=\"\" width=\"1200\" height=\"663\"><br>\n<em>SDF‚Äìa mathematical function describing the \"<a href=\"../How%20to%20draw%20a%20Janusz\">Januszness</a>\" vs. an approximation using polygons and vertices</em></p>\n<p>In practice this means that certain shapes are much easier to define and render using SDF, whereas in other cases using meshes will be more performant. This also allows for a slightly different coding style.</p>\n<p>For instance, when I saw this line in the first code example:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">sphere(0.7 + n); // draw a sphere by adding noise to each point\n</code></pre>\n<p>I was a bit lost. I mean, how come adding a noise value <code>n</code> to the sphere radius doesn't change the <em>entire</em> sphere, but <em>blobbifies</em> it so beautifully? The simple answer is that SDF calculates <em>how far a <strong>given point in space</strong> is from the <strong>surface of the shape</strong></em>. So, by adding noise, we're distorting the result of that function, for each pixel on your screen.</p>\n<p>Now, I've been building games and messing with generative art for a relatively long time, long enough to know <em>how little I know</em> about graphics programming.  So, please take anything I say here with a bag of salt and check out some of these resources if you want to learn more:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://renderdiagrams.org/2017/12/28/signed-distance-fields/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Signed Distance Fields ‚Äì Render Diagrams</a>.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.alanzucconi.com/2016/07/01/signed-distance-functions/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Volumetric Rendering: Signed Distance Functions - Alan Zucconi</a> ‚Äì very in-depth (I'm still digging through it)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://thebookofshaders.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The Book of Shaders</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Midnight</h2>\n<p>Why am I playing with Shader Park? I want to add a simple background animation to <a href=\"https://midnight.sonnet.io\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">midnight.sonnet.io</a>. The animation I have in mind adds a bit of smooth, \"silky\" shading to the text. It's almost imperceptible, and looks a bit like a smooth satin sheet (how sensual and classy, I know).</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"/.11ty/image/?src=src%2Fnotes%2Fmidnight-satin-experiment.webp&amp;width=1200&amp;format=webp&amp;via=transform\" alt=\"\" width=\"1200\" height=\"896\"></p>\n<p>Simplex noise rendered using WebGL seems like a perfect way of achieving the look I'm after, but the developer experience and amount of boilerplate required to set them up seems like overkill (at least to me).</p>\n<p>Next week I'll post a note on noise, procedural generation and animated shaders. If you know me, you won't be surprised to learn that I tried to implement it using a bunch of hacks first, so expect also CSS custom props and gradients.</p>\n<p><s>For now, feel free to check out the experiment <a href=\"https://night-reader-site-git-feat-shader-park-sonnet.vercel.app/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">here</a>.

Got an idea worth building and looking for help? <a href='https://consulting.sonnet.io'>Hit me up</a>\n</p>\n\n<img src=\"https://www.potato.horse/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.ctfassets.net%2Fhyylafu4fjks%2F6V5fDScCop1JldwrMirU4k%2F8d244f82b29896cd27768be7082866ba%2F121229468_2704770533116212_5061190494302715619_n_18167306878053343.jpg&w=1920&q=75\" alt=\"\"/>\n*Alternative title: Shader Park I: Enter the Blob*\n\n[Shader park](https://shaderpark.com) is a Javascript library that allows you to create interactive shaders. It's inspired by processing / p5.js, and provides a series of functions that make it much easier to use than working with plain GLSL code.\n\nThe project is still fairly new and rough around the edges, but it's so much fun to work with! I had to exercise a lot of willpower to stick to writing this note, as I kept coming back to it and sketching little animations.\n\nIn that sense it reminds me a bit of [tixy](https://tixy.land): it *feels* like a toy but can spit out something that looks really cool even with minimal effort. For instance, [look at this blob](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sz2mmM-kN1I):\n\n<iframe src=\"https://shaderpark.com/embed/-Nl4jm_zJfCuBt4t2C9J\" frameborder=\"0\" style='aspect-ratio:4/3'></iframe>\n\nThis is the code required to generate it:\n\n```javascript\nlet scale = 2.0;\nlet s = getSpace();\nlet n = 0.2 * noise(scale * s + time); \n\t// generate a noise value based on the space coords, scale, \n\t// and time (to create an animation)\n\t\ncolor(1,.3,.7) // set the color in rgb space (0...1)\n\nsphere(0.7 + n); // draw a sphere by adding noise to each point\n```\n\nAnd here's an even simpler example:\n\n<iframe src=\"https://shaderpark.com/embed/-Nl4oPqg6gBLRIIlq8s1\" frameborder=\"0\" style='aspect-ratio: 4/3'></iframe>\n\n\n```javascript\n// move coords\ndisplace(0, -.45, 0) \n\n// enable shape blending\nblend(.5)    \n\n// set the color to red        \ncolor(1,0,0) \n\n// draw a small box\nbox(0.6, .1, .3) \n\n// move coords\ndisplace(0, .9, 0) \n\n// draw another small sphere in the same coords\nsphere(0.5 + sin(time) * .2) \n```\n\n*Ignore the `sin(time)` bit for now. We're using it to create a looped animation. More on that next week ([Midnight Shader](<../Midnight Shader>)).*\n\nSo, how does this work?\n\n## Signed Distance Field (SDF)\n\nInstead of meshes and polygons Shader Park relies on an algorithm called Signed Distance Fields. \n\n[Alan Zucconi](https://www.alanzucconi.com) compares vertex based rendering and SDF to pixels and SVG: all vertex meshes representing curved shapes are just approximations. SDF represents entire shapes as mathematical functions, thus allowing for a much higher level of detail, whereas a 3D mesh will have a finite level of detail depending on its  polygon count. \n\n![3016](sdf-vs-polygons-janusz.webp)\n*SDF‚Äìa mathematical function describing the \"[Januszness](<../How to draw a Janusz>)\" vs. an approximation using polygons and vertices*\n\nIn practice this means that certain shapes are much easier to define and render using SDF, whereas in other cases using meshes will be more performant. This also allows for a slightly different coding style. \n\nFor instance, when I saw this line in the first code example:\n\n```js\nsphere(0.7 + n); // draw a sphere by adding noise to each point\n```\n\nI was a bit lost. I mean, how come adding a noise value `n` to the sphere radius doesn't change the *entire* sphere, but *blobbifies* it so beautifully? The simple answer is that SDF calculates *how far a **given point in space** is from the **surface of the shape***. So, by adding noise, we're distorting the result of that function, for each pixel on your screen.\n\nNow, I've been building games and messing with generative art for a relatively long time, long enough to know *how little I know* about graphics programming.  So, please take anything I say here with a bag of salt and check out some of these resources if you want to learn more:\n\n- [Signed Distance Fields ‚Äì Render Diagrams](https://renderdiagrams.org/2017/12/28/signed-distance-fields/). \n- [Volumetric Rendering: Signed Distance Functions - Alan Zucconi](https://www.alanzucconi.com/2016/07/01/signed-distance-functions/) ‚Äì very in-depth (I'm still digging through it)\n- [The Book of Shaders](https://thebookofshaders.com/)\n\n## Midnight\n\nWhy am I playing with Shader Park? I want to add a simple background animation to [midnight.sonnet.io](https://midnight.sonnet.io). The animation I have in mind adds a bit of smooth, \"silky\" shading to the text. It's almost imperceptible, and looks a bit like a smooth satin sheet (how sensual and classy, I know).\n\n![4854](midnight-satin-experiment.webp)\n\nSimplex noise rendered using WebGL seems like a perfect way of achieving the look I'm after, but the developer experience and amount of boilerplate required to set them up seems like overkill (at least to me).\n\nNext week I'll post a note on noise, procedural generation and animated shaders. If you know me, you won't be surprised to learn that I tried to implement it using a bunch of hacks first, so expect also CSS custom props and gradients. \n\n~~For now, feel free to check out the experiment [here](https://night-reader-site-git-feat-shader-park-sonnet.vercel.app/). See you tomorrow!~~\n\nOK, the follow-up with some more in-depth comments is ready here: [Midnight Shader](<../Midnight Shader>)!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

And, deep down, they want you to feel good about your work (partly because it makes them feel good.) If you give them an object that looks finished, they might be afraid to break it!</p>\n<p>Scrappy, messy work is like a sandbox. It's an invitation to play. When people are not afraid to break your precious toy, they're more likely to experiment with it. They might even suggest new ways of playing with it! Give people toys, we <a href=\"../Here's%20a%20List%20of%20Toys\">need more toys</a>.</p>\n<p>This is a trick used often in iterative design methodologies (e.g. Human-centred design), and I imagine a part of the reason why tools like Balsamiq or excalidraw are popular.</p>\n<h4>Counter-example</h4>\n<p>In my experience, people represented by the clich√© Hackernews <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9224\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">comment</a> are an exception to the rule and a minority small enough that focusing on them is (generally) a distraction. <a href=\"../How%20to%20identify%20useful%20feedback?\">How to identify useful feedback?</a></p>\n<h3>It saves your time.</h3>\n<p><a href=\"../Your%20time%20is%20the%20most%20valuable%20thing%20you%20have\">Your time is the most valuable thing you have</a>. It's much easier and <strong>cheaper</strong> to get feedback at this stage. What's the point of spending several days on a project just to learn that your users don't understand or care about the idea?</p>\n<p>If you're building for an audience larger than 1 (you), erring on the side of illconceived caution generally has the opposite of the desired effect: you're more likely to set yourself up for failure (and make it more expensive.)</p>\n<p>I noticed that the longer I postpone sharing my work, the more anxious I get. It makes perfect sense: coding instead of sharing <em>feels</em> like work, it makes me <em>feel</em> like I <em>have control</em>, but more often than not it's a form of self sabotage. It's a form of procrastination and procrastination is an avoidance mechanism. If this paragraph resonated with you, you might want to check out my longer article: <a href=\"https://sonnet.io/posts/hummingbirds/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Hummingbirds are Evil! Procrastination, Laziness and Play</a>.</p>\n<h3>Deep down, at a very basic level we need to feel recognised.</h3>\n<p>This is something that comes up very often during my <a href=\"https://sonnet.io/posts/hi\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Say Hi</a> calls and is of particular importance to me. We need to see that our actions don't exist in a vacuum, that our actions impact people. I'm not talking about extrinsic motivation or a sense of self-worth, but something much more simple than that: we are social creatures, not cats. We need social contact almost just as much as we need food or water.</p>\n<p>A carpenter or cleaner will see both the physical results of their work and the faces of the people interacting with it. Many software engineers or designers work on projects they rarely use, for people they'll never see. I believe that this is our occupational hazard as much as losing fingers was to my dad, or back pain/dermatitis to my mom.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>a means of achieving market fit</li>\n<li>a requirement for a healthy, happy team</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Short feedback loops are more than a means of achieving market fit, narrowing down the user need. They also help us get out of our head, see that we're making progress, make our work feel real. In my opinion, this is something that outstanding team leads do.</p>\n<h3>You're unlikely to regret it.</h3>\n<p>I rarely regret sharing my experiments sooner. Come to think of it, I never do! Generally the response is inversely proportional to the time spent on them. That's because the longer I work on something in isolation, the more likely I am to spend too much time in my own head and focus on the parts that people neither need, nor care about.</p>\n<p>Plus, sharing and making myself somewhat vulnerable this way does get easier with time. Here's an example. I've been delaying sharing a complete list of my personal work for about 10 years. 10 years. 10 years! What the fuck! The week when I added a <a href=\"https://sonnet.io/projects\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Projects</a> page to my main site felt horrible. I couldn't sleep, I'd cry, I'd stare at my computer screen for hours and get nothing done.

You're much more likely to receive useful feedback\n2. You will save a ton of the most precious resource you have (time)\n3. You will fulfil a basic human need\n\n## Slightly longer version\n\nBy sharing unfinished work:\n\n### You're much more likely to receive useful feedback.\n\nPeople are kind. And, deep down, they want you to feel good about your work (partly because it makes them feel good.) If you give them an object that looks finished, they might be afraid to break it! \n\nScrappy, messy work is like a sandbox. It's an invitation to play. When people are not afraid to break your precious toy, they're more likely to experiment with it. They might even suggest new ways of playing with it! Give people toys, we [need more toys](<../Here's a List of Toys>).\n\nThis is a trick used often in iterative design methodologies (e.g. Human-centred design), and I imagine a part of the reason why tools like Balsamiq or excalidraw are popular.\n\n#### Counter-example\nIn my experience, people represented by the clich√© Hackernews [comment](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9224) are an exception to the rule and a minority small enough that focusing on them is (generally) a distraction. [How to identify useful feedback?](<../How to identify useful feedback?>)\n\n### It saves your time.\n\n[Your time is the most valuable thing you have](<../Your time is the most valuable thing you have>). It's much easier and **cheaper** to get feedback at this stage. What's the point of spending several days on a project just to learn that your users don't understand or care about the idea? \n\nIf you're building for an audience larger than 1 (you), erring on the side of illconceived caution generally has the opposite of the desired effect: you're more likely to set yourself up for failure (and make it more expensive.) \n\nI noticed that the longer I postpone sharing my work, the more anxious I get. It makes perfect sense: coding instead of sharing *feels* like work, it makes me *feel* like I *have control*, but more often than not it's a form of self sabotage. It's a form of procrastination and procrastination is an avoidance mechanism. If this paragraph resonated with you, you might want to check out my longer article: [Hummingbirds are Evil! Procrastination, Laziness and Play](https://sonnet.io/posts/hummingbirds/).\n\n\n\n### Deep down, at a very basic level we need to feel recognised.\n\nThis is something that comes up very often during my [Say Hi](https://sonnet.io/posts/hi) calls and is of particular importance to me. We need to see that our actions don't exist in a vacuum, that our actions impact people. I'm not talking about extrinsic motivation or a sense of self-worth, but something much more simple than that: we are social creatures, not cats. We need social contact almost just as much as we need food or water.\n\nA carpenter or cleaner will see both the physical results of their work and the faces of the people interacting with it. Many software engineers or designers work on projects they rarely use, for people they'll never see. I believe that this is our occupational hazard as much as losing fingers was to my dad, or back pain/dermatitis to my mom.\n\n- a means of achieving market fit\n- a requirement for a healthy, happy team\n\nShort feedback loops are more than a means of achieving market fit, narrowing down the user need. They also help us get out of our head, see that we're making progress, make our work feel real. In my opinion, this is something that outstanding team leads do.\n\n\n### You're unlikely to regret it.\n\nI rarely regret sharing my experiments sooner. Come to think of it, I never do! Generally the response is inversely proportional to the time spent on them. That's because the longer I work on something in isolation, the more likely I am to spend too much time in my own head and focus on the parts that people neither need, nor care about. \n\nPlus, sharing and making myself somewhat vulnerable this way does get easier with time. Here's an example. I've been delaying sharing a complete list of my personal work for about 10 years. 10 years. 10 years! What the fuck! The week when I added a [Projects](https://sonnet.io/projects) page to my main site felt horrible. I couldn't sleep, I'd cry, I'd stare at my computer screen for hours and get nothing done. From the outside, there's nothing objectively difficult about this (perhaps besides debugging `.njk` templates). It should be fun. It should be an excuse to celebrate. I've shown my work work to 1000s people through pitches on stage, video calls, client meetings. I'm an adult! The truth is that after a decade of avoiding a once simple problem, it grew to a size where I just couldn't conceptualise dealing with it.\n\nPerhaps to some of the people reading this, this sounds silly, but on the off chance this resonates with you, know that there's always hope, unless procrastination becomes a competitive sport, in which case ‚Äì don't fuck with me, you'll have some tough competition to deal with.\n\nLet people play with your toys.

For instance, the package would spit out icons with padding and an ugly white border on iOS. This could've been a configuration issue on my side. To solve the issue I just exported that particular icon from Figma instead of generating it in a script. If this bites me again, I'll fix it. But hey, we're talking about a <a href=\"../MISS%20%E2%80%93%20Make%20It%20Stupid,%20Simple\">glorified gong</a> here and something I update 1-2 times per year.

This is the kind of mistake I'm likely to repeat in future and by writing it down here I have a better chance of committing this to memory (and perhaps saving some of the hair you'd pull out if you ended up in the same situation.)</p>\n<h2>Next steps</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>Improve discoverability</li>\n<li>Standalone app layout</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Improve discoverability</h3>\n<p>Sit. is an app now, fantastic! Now, we'll need to tell our users that they can use it. We can do so by adding app install banners on Android and iOS. Historically this has been always easier on Android than iOS (<a href=\"../Apple%20PWA%20support%20is%20(still)%20malicious%20compliance\">Apple PWA support is (still) malicious compliance</a>).</p>\n<p>On Android, we can achieve that by adding a splash screen and handing the <code>beforeinstallprompt</code> event (<a href=\"https://web.dev/articles/customize-install\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">docs</a>).</p>\n<p>On iOS this is a bit trickier, but still solvable with custom work:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Check the current platform and device</li>\n<li>Check if the app is already running in standalone mode</li>\n<li>Check if the user has visited the site before</li>\n<li>Display a custom install banner with platform-specific instructions</li>\n</ol>\n<p>That's all for today.

    "rawInput": "![a smiling char, text saying \"sit.\" on its side](https://sit.sonnet.io/social.png)\n\nI posted Sit. on HN earlier this month and it blew up, with more than 50k people visiting the site in the space of a day or so. What the hell! The feedback has been overwhelmingly positive and so, so many people reached out to me via email/DMs or even text (someone even dug up my phone number). All of that just to say that they enjoyed it. I needed to hear that and I am grateful that I can still do this sort of work. \n\nAs I was reading the comments on HN, one thing in particular stood out:\n\n![645](Pasted%20image%2020240109121539.png)\n\n![683](Pasted%20image%2020240109121606.png)\n\nSo, I shipped a change making Sit. a Progressive Web App (PWA) this morning.\n\n![799](sit-offline-android-ios.webp)\n\nTo check it out go to [sit.sonnet.io](https://sit.sonnet.io) and hit *Install App (Android)* or *Add to Home Screen (iOS)*:\n\n![959](sit-offline-setup.webp)\n\nNow, the rest of this note will discuss a) the current progress, b) implementation, and c) the next steps in this process.\n\n## Done\n\nMost of the changes are pretty self-explanatory:\n\n- **Offline mode:** the app works without internet connection\n- **Seamless presentation:** the browser chrome is hidden\n\n## Implementation\n\nYou can find the minimal requirements a site needs to fulfil to be considered a PWA [here](https://vite-pwa-org.netlify.app/guide/pwa-minimal-requirements.html#pwa-minimal-requirements). But in a nutshell, this boils down to:\n\n- server config so we can support offline mode via Service Workers (mainly, HTTPS)\n- metadata describing the app (using Web App Manifest)\n- corresponding assets (icons, title, description)\n\nLuckily, nowadays most of this work can be offloaded to platforms and libraries:\n\n- managing domains, SSL ‚Üí [Vercel](https://vercel.com)\n- generating the manifest file and configuring the service worker ‚Üí [Vite PWA](https://vite-pwa-org.netlify.app)\n\n I've burned myself so many times in build tool plugin dependency hell that I'm biased towards using my own delicious home cooked code for these sorts for things, but the Vite ecosystem keeps proving me wrong. \n \n Things just worked‚Ñ¢ and got me 99% of the way to where I wanted to be. \n\n### Vite PWA, Offline, Metadata\n\nInstall the [Vite PWA](https://github.com/vite-pwa/vite-plugin-pwa) extension and configure it:\n\n```ts\n// vite.config.mts\n\nexport default defineConfig({\n  plugins: [\n    /*...*/\n    VitePWA({\n      manifest: {\n        start_url: \"/\",\n        background_color: \"#000000\",\n        description:\n          \"Share with a friend who needs to sit the fuck down or enjoy the experience yourself.\",\n        name: \"Sit.\",\n        short_name: \"Sit.\",\n        orientation: \"portrait\",\n        theme_color: \"#000000\",\n        icons: [\n          {\n            src: \"pwa-64x64.png\",\n            sizes: \"64x64\",\n            type: \"image/png\",\n          }, /* ... */\n        ],\n      },\n      registerType: \"autoUpdate\",\n      devOptions: {\n        enabled: process.env.SW_DEV === \"true\",\n      },\n      workbox: {\n        globPatterns: [\"**/*.{js,css,html,woff2,svg,mp3}\"],\n      },\n    }),\n  ],\n```\n\n### Cache non-standard asset types\n\n[Workbox](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/workbox/) is a set of Service Worker related tools that power Vite PWA and enable its offline capabilities. By default only js/css/HTML files are cached in offline mode. Since Sit. relies on both audio assets and custom fonts, we needed to add those too:\n\n```ts\nworkbox: {\n\tglobPatterns: [\"**/*.{js,css,html,woff2,svg,mp3}\"],\n},\n```\n\n### Icons\n\n![3609](sit-offline-figma-icons.webp)\n\nI'm using @vite-pwa/assets-generator to generate images in the right sizes and formats. \n\n```json\n// package.json\n\"scripts\": {\n    /*. .. */\n    \"generate-assets\": \"pwa-assets-generator --preset minimal-2023 public/app-icon.svg\",\n```\n\n### Adaptive/Maskable icons\n\n![3908](sit-offline-ios-home-screen.webp)\n\nModern Android apps support maskable icons. In short, using a maskable icon allows you to tell the OS/User Agent to wrap your full-bleed icons in its own \"chrome\". This means you can decouple your icon design from a specific OS version. Neat! You can learn more about Maskable Icons [here](https://web.dev/articles/maskable-icon).\n\nThere were some rough edges, but nothing serious. For instance, the package would spit out icons with padding and an ugly white border on iOS. This could've been a configuration issue on my side. To solve the issue I just exported that particular icon from Figma instead of generating it in a script. If this bites me again, I'll fix it. But hey, we're talking about a [glorified gong](<../MISS ‚Äì Make It Stupid, Simple>) here and something I update 1-2 times per year. I need to pick my battles.\n\n### `name` vs.`short_name`\n\n```ts\n// vite.config.mts\n\nexport default defineConfig({\n  plugins: [\n    /*...*/\n    VitePWA({\n      manifest: {\n      /*...*/\n        name: \"Sit.\",\n        short_name: \"Sit.\",\n/*...*/\n```\n        \nIf `name`/`short_name` are not populated, the app will inherit the Home Screen icon title from the `package.json` file. `Sit.` is **not** a valid package name, so we need to specify it here.\n\nWhy am I mentioning this? This is the kind of mistake I'm likely to repeat in future and by writing it down here I have a better chance of committing this to memory (and perhaps saving some of the hair you'd pull out if you ended up in the same situation.)\n\n\n## Next steps\n\n1. Improve discoverability\n2. Standalone app layout\n\n### Improve discoverability\n\nSit. is an app now, fantastic! Now, we'll need to tell our users that they can use it. We can do so by adding app install banners on Android and iOS. Historically this has been always easier on Android than iOS ([Apple PWA support is (still) malicious compliance](<../Apple PWA support is (still) malicious compliance>)).\n\nOn Android, we can achieve that by adding a splash screen and handing the `beforeinstallprompt` event ([docs](https://web.dev/articles/customize-install)).\n\nOn iOS this is a bit trickier, but still solvable with custom work:\n\n1. Check the current platform and device\n2. Check if the app is already running in standalone mode\n3. Check if the user has visited the site before\n4. Display a custom install banner with platform-specific instructions\n\nThat's all for today. See you tomorrow!\n\n## Related:\n\n[What PWA Can Do Today](https://whatpwacando.today)\n[Maskable.app](https://maskable.app)\n"

I have a little finger piano at home, and regardless of however you play it, it just sounds so sweet. (I might sample them myself in the next update.)\n\nI tried several approaches:\n\n#### Fully generative audio with [Tone.js](https://tonejs.github.io).\n\nThis approach gives me plenty of control when it comes to pitch, reverb and duration of sounds. However, the sounds I wanted to use tended to be fairly complex (harmonically rich) and  thus difficult to reproduce. I have neither enough time nor the experience to create anything I'd be happy with quality-wise.\n\n#### Use a real recording, change pitch dynamically\n\nThis is a good compromise, but I couldn't find the right samples given the self-imposed time constraints. I'm slow.\n\nThe first two approaches reminded me of the work of [Tero Parviainen](https://teropa.info)‚Äîmy old colleague and the most experienced person I know when it comes to anything related to generative audio.\n\nBe sure to check out his work.

Consider them sketches for the feature you want to implement. I'd call it a dry run, but a good spike is anything but dry: it's wet, it's messy and it has a familiar, enticing, yet disturbing (yet enticing) smell.</p>\n<p>I use them both for personal projects and when working with larger teams on complex, well-tested code bases.</p>\n<p>It's not rocket science, it's fucking around and finding out science. But don't be deceived, there's a reason why some people are better at spiking than others. Let's take a closer look.</p>\n<h2>Here's how you do it:</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>Think briefly of how and what you want to build (duh).</li>\n<li>Move on straight to prototyping. Don't overthink it. Don't write tests, just doodle, you crazy diamond!</li>\n<li>Start with the uncertain changes first. This is important. Just like a good sketch is both playful and selective, a spike is about messing around and answering the non-obvious questions quickly (<em>How do these two modules fit together?</em> <em>Will the user know how to use X?</em> or if in React-land: <em>How do I pass state from X to Y?</em>).</li>\n<li>Feeling lost?

    "rawInput": "\n![116](bees-spike.webp)\n\nCode spikes are simple throwaway pieces of work. Consider them sketches for the feature you want to implement. I'd call it a dry run, but a good spike is anything but dry: it's wet, it's messy and it has a familiar, enticing, yet disturbing (yet enticing) smell.\n\nI use them both for personal projects and when working with larger teams on complex, well-tested code bases.\n\nIt's not rocket science, it's fucking around and finding out science. But don't be deceived, there's a reason why some people are better at spiking than others. Let's take a closer look.\n\n## Here's how you do it:\n\n1. Think briefly of how and what you want to build (duh).\n2. Move on straight to prototyping. Don't overthink it. Don't write tests, just doodle, you crazy diamond!\n3. Start with the uncertain changes first. This is important. Just like a good sketch is both playful and selective, a spike is about messing around and answering the non-obvious questions quickly (_How do these two modules fit together?_ _Will the user know how to use X?_ or if in React-land: _How do I pass state from X to Y?_).\n4. Feeling lost? Throw it out and start again! Get used to the discomfort. Good sketches are fast and cheap. ([Kill your darlings, their bones are the best fertiliser](<../Kill your darlings, their bones are the best fertiliser>))\n5. Now, finish as soon as you know **enough**. Enough means that you've answered your key questions (_How many parts of the systems do we need to touch?_ _Does this thing even make sense?_). Don't answer the obvious questions just to practice typing.\n6. Know enough and are happy with the results?\n   1. If working solo:\n      1. Give it a moment to rest. A moment here could mean a single pomodoro, a coffee break or leaving it until the next morning.\n   2. If working in a team:\n      1. Share them with your team for a quick Story Time/DEMO. The point of which is:\n         1. a \"sanity check\" ‚Äî does my approach make sense?\n         2. avoiding reinventing the wheel, finding shortcuts\n         3. finding alignment\n7. Look at it again.\n8. Throw it out. This important. Don't directly copy the spiked code. If I feel emotionally attached to my code I tell it I need to grab a pack of smokes from the store and will be back in 5 minutes. Then I put it on a separate branch lying to myself that I'll revisit it.\n9. Implement things following the appropriate practices, e.g. TDD and pairing for larger projects or a small amount of tests for smaller things.\n\n## Why?\n\nThey help me come up with better ideas, allow me to be more concise and communicate my changes better. I also don't get bogged own in details because I let myself play and explore. This is similar to how and why I use [Ens≈ç](https://enso.sonnet.io): to separate writing from editing.\n\nSpikes are fun.\n\n### Other less obvious reasons:\n\nSpikes with Story Time‚Ñ¢ can improve alignment, esp. in teams without a strong testing or pair programming culture. You should still consider writing tests and pairing _first_, really ([Pair Programming with Snakes](https://sonnet.io/posts/snakes)).\n\nSpikes help you get better at working iteratively. Being able to switch between these two modes of thinking is an important, transferrable skill. And, as with any skill, it can be improved with some practice. In my experience this has worked well with teams without a strong TDD/testing culture or with unexperienced engineers.

    "rawInput": "I was going to publish my review of Obsidian Publish today, but I realised it would get too long and messy to be useful. Instead of publishing it as one long blog post, I'll share it as several smaller, connected notes. This way you'll be able to read the review at your own pace and the level of detail you like. It's more fun this way anyway ([Wikipedia rabbit holes and writing evergreen notes](<../Wikipedia rabbit holes and writing evergreen notes>)).\n\n![573](here-comes-the-sun.webp)\n\n\n1. **[This is not writing or productivity advice](<../This is not writing or productivity advice>)**.\n2. Please don't pay too much attention to the tools I use. Pen and paper is fine. I'm picky and eat my own dogfood ([Projects and apps I built for my own well-being](<../Projects and apps I built for my own well-being>)).\n\n## I journal to:\n\n- be more aware of my emotions and thought patterns, feel more present\n- to have a space to think without editing myself (divergent thinking)\n- to notice broader patterns in my life, in my behaviour \n- to rant\n- to practice taking different perspectives (reframing)\n- to build snapshots of my life at a given moment (that realisation/goal came after a few months of writing, it wasn't my plan)\n\n\n## My Morning Notes: Short Version\n\n1. wake up, ingest caffeine and dihydrogen oxide\n2. write for about 20-40 minutes in [Ens≈ç](https://enso.sonnet.io)\n3. copy the notes to Obsidian\n\n## Slightly longer version\n\n<span id=\"^6f8ae1\" class=\"link-marker\">^6f8ae1</span>\n\nI start my day by writing in [Ens≈ç](https://enso.sonnet.io)  ‚Äî a \"stream of consciousness\" app I wrote for myself. Ens≈ç makes it really hard for you to edit text, so you start focusing on *what you want to say* instead of *how you want to say it*. In that sense it's similar to using a typewriter or a piece of paper and a pen. Record the fleeting thoughts, and move on.\n\nMy journal didn't have much structure to start with, but with time patterns emerged. That was not the intent from day one. Every day rhymes with the previous one. It just takes time to notice that.\n\nI'm also not a good typist, but I write these notes relatively fast. I don't worry about typos, grammatical errors or sounding \"stupid\", incoherent, weird. It doesn't matter.\n\n![2211](morning%20notes%20diagram.webp)\n\nWriting this way is like playing a Choose Your Own Adventure game. You might know roughly where you'll end up but you rarely know how to get there! So, I don't worry about keeping the chronological order of events. If anything comes to my mind, I just write it down and move on. This means that often I go back to a previous event, a semi-random tangent, fast forward. Ens≈ç makes it very easy.\n\n### Here's what I do, step by step:\n\n**1\\. Describe how I felt when I woke up.**\n\n- did I dream?\n- do I feel stressed, anxious, high-energy, lazy, unfocused, content?\n\n**2\\. Describe how my day went, by replaying it in my head, step by step.**\n\n1. Write down my thoughts and feelings *as I think and feel them*.\n\t1. How I felt *then*?\n\t2. How do I feel about them *now*?\n2. Try to avoid judgement or general statements, just record the thought, event, feeling, observations.\n3. Try to separate feelings from the person feeling them. Feelings are real, but not necessarily true\n4. Don't worry about chronology, tangents, just fast-forward or rewind.\n\n**3\\. Describe how I felt in the evening, before going to bed.**\n\n**4\\. List the beautiful or interesting things I noticed.** \n\nBeautiful or interesting are very subjective categories:\n\n1. Sunset over Douro as seen from Virtudes.\n2. A tree growing in an abandoned building.\n3. A grave in [Cemit√©rio de Agramonte](https://www.tripadvisor.pt/Attraction_Review-g189180-d6523088-Reviews-Cemiterio_de_Agramonte-Porto_Porto_District_Northern_Portugal.html).\n4. Snuggling with Luna and Mango on the couch. Mango releasing a mean fart.\n\n**5\\. Write down my todo list for the day:**\n\nI try to plan my week every Monday. The plan includes a bunch of must-haves (e.g. apply to *\\<company name>*, chat with people via my [Say Hi](https://sonnet.io/posts/hi) calls) and the routine stuff that's good for me (go climbing, go for a walk with Luna and Mango) but easy to forget when I get busy. I treat the weekly plan as a menu of things to pick from. The daily note as the daily menu based on that.\n\n**6\\. Copy the notes to Daily Notes in Obsidian**\n\n**7\\. Paste the todo list into my weekly plan**\n\n\n## What have I learned so far?\n\nGenerally, I feel much more present during the day when I write in the morning.\n\n**This is a big one for me:** It's easier to spot red flags (lowered mood, anxiety, lack of focus, avoidance) and work with them.

It's cross-platform (thanks to <a href=\"https://justine.lol/cosmopolitan/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">cosmopolitan libc</a>) and super easy to set up:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>download <a href=\"https://huggingface.co/jartine/llava-v1.5-7B-GGUF/resolve/main/llava-v1.5-7b-q4.llamafile?download=true\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">the llamafile</a> (<code>llava</code> in this case)</li>\n<li><code>$ chmod +x name.llamafile</code></li>\n<li><code>$ ./name.llamafile</code> (starts a server with chatbot GUI on localhost:8080)</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I've been using since the the moment it came out. And, I'd use it for anything I wouldn't want to share with third-parties (i.e. most of my private writing). You can read more about <code>llamafile</code> on Simon Willison's <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/2023/Nov/29/llamafile/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">blog</a> or in their official <a href=\"https://github.com/Mozilla-Ocho/llamafile\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">README</a>.</p>\n<p>The <code>llamafile</code> server opens up an API endpoint compatible with the OpenAI client, so you can talk to it via CURL or using the <code>openai</code> package.</p>\n<p>Here's the <code>llamafile</code> based version of <code>summarise_single_note</code>:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-python\">def summarise_single_note(note_content):\n    client = OpenAI(\n        base_url=\"http://localhost:8080/v1\",\n        api_key=\"sk-no-key-required\",\n    )\n    completion = client.chat.completions.create(\n        model=\"LLaMA_CPP\",\n        messages=[\n            {\n                \"role\": \"system\",\n\t\t\t\t\"content\": \"You are SummariserBot.

    "rawInput": "![121](human-llama.webp)\n\n*<strong>human llama</strong> was the brand behind your favourite AAA titles such as \"[Tommy the Toe](<../Tommy the Toe>) and the Chamber of Hostile Carpentry\" and [\"How to Run an All-hands Meeting\"](https://rafsters.itch.io/all-hands)*\n\nI wrote a quick script to summarise and process my [Stream of Consciousness Morning Notes](<../Stream of Consciousness Morning Notes>). You can find the repo [here](https://github.com/paprikka/review-notes-article-sample).\n\n## Why\n\n1. because a bunch of people ([Ens≈ç](https://enso.sonnet.io) users and [Say Hi](<../Say Hi>) friends) are using LLMs with the Ens≈ç output in a variety of interesting ways (more on that in another post)\n2. because I believe that the open/offline models are they way to go\n\t1. for [many](https://locusmag.com/2023/12/commentary-cory-doctorow-what-kind-of-bubble-is-ai/) reasons (besides the obvious ethical implications)\n3. because I wanted to play with [ollama](http://ollama.ai) and [llamafile](http://llamafile.ai)\n4. because it seemed like a fun thing to do (and it was!)\n\nFinally, every Monday morning I spend 20-30m to review my previous week ([New Week](<../New Week>)). During the review I like to sometimes skim through my daily notes to see if anything interesting (mood, language, tone changes) piques my attention.\n\nNone of this takes much time and I enjoy the process itself, but I thought it might be fun to spike a quick script and see I can find anything interesting to share with you.\n\n## How it works\n\n### Short version:\n\nRead the most recent daily entries from my morning notes, summarise them, extract some key sections (e.g. [Beautiful Things](<../Beautiful Things>)) and collate everything into a markdown file.\n\n#### 1\\. Find the 7 most recent notes in my Obsidian vault:\n\n```python\ndir_path = \"/Users/raf/Library/Mobile Documents/iCloud~md~obsidian/Documents/sol/Diary/\"\nfiles = [f for f in os.listdir(dir_path) if f.endswith(\".md\")]\n# yyyy-mm-dd\nsorted_files = sorted(files, reverse=True)[:7]\n```\n\n#### 2\\. Summarise using ollama/llama2\n\nollama just released their [JS](https://github.com/ollama/ollama-js) and [Python](https://github.com/ollama/ollama-python) packages. At the time of writing this the JS has some [rough edges](https://github.com/ollama/ollama-js/issues/27), so I went with the Python version instead.\n\n```python\ndef summarise_single_note(note_content):\n    response = ollama.chat(\n        model=\"llama2\",\n        messages=[\n            {\n                \"role\": \"user\",\n                \"content\": f\"\"\"\n        \n        Summarise the note below under 100 words.\n        Use markdown bullet points.\n        Every bullet point is one sentence.\n        \n        Note:\n        {note_content}\n        \"\"\".strip(),\n            },\n        ],\n    )\n\n    return response[\"message\"][\"content\"]\n\n```\n\n#### 3\\. Extract \"[Beautiful Things](<../Beautiful Things>)\"\n\nAfter a few years of writing my daily notes have developed a common [structure](<../Stream of Consciousness Morning Notes>). In short: they usually end with a TODO list for the day and a list of Beautiful Things I noticed. Normally, I'd just use a regular expression for this sort of work:\n\n```python\ndef list_beautiful_things(note_content):\n    response = ollama.chat(\n        model=\"llama2\",\n        messages=[\n            {\n                \"role\": \"user\",\n                \"content\": f\"\"\"\nThe note below contains a list of \"Beautiful Things\". \n\n== EXAMPLE_START ==\nBeautiful things:\n\n- Luna's amazing focaccia\n- playing with the dog before dinner\n\n== EXAMPLE_END ==\n\nExtract the beautiful things from the note below. Do not introduce any new information. Do not include any text besides the list of beautiful things. Do not include the \"Today:\" list. \n\n        Note:\n        {note_content}\n        \"\"\".strip(),\n            },\n        ],\n    )\n\n    return response[\"message\"][\"content\"]\n\n\n```\n\n4\\. Save everything to a markdown file.\n```python\nnote = list_beautiful_things(content)\nwith open(beautiful_things_path, \"a\") as result_file:\n\tresult_file.write(note)\n```\n\n\n\n\n## TIL\n\n### llamafile vs. ollama\n\nI started my experiment by using `llamafile` and then moved to `ollama`. `llamafile` is a standalone executable containing model weights, and a simple web server with a chat GUI. It's cross-platform (thanks to [cosmopolitan libc](https://justine.lol/cosmopolitan/)) and super easy to set up:\n\n1. download [the llamafile](https://huggingface.co/jartine/llava-v1.5-7B-GGUF/resolve/main/llava-v1.5-7b-q4.llamafile?download=true) (`llava` in this case)\n2. `$ chmod +x name.llamafile`\n3. `$ ./name.llamafile` (starts a server with chatbot GUI on localhost:8080)\n\nI've been using since the the moment it came out. And, I'd use it for anything I wouldn't want to share with third-parties (i.e. most of my private writing). You can read more about `llamafile` on Simon Willison's [blog](https://simonwillison.net/2023/Nov/29/llamafile/) or in their official [README](https://github.com/Mozilla-Ocho/llamafile). \n\nThe `llamafile` server opens up an API endpoint compatible with the OpenAI client, so you can talk to it via CURL or using the `openai` package. \n\nHere's the `llamafile` based version of `summarise_single_note`:\n\n```python\ndef summarise_single_note(note_content):\n    client = OpenAI(\n        base_url=\"http://localhost:8080/v1\",\n        api_key=\"sk-no-key-required\",\n    )\n    completion = client.chat.completions.create(\n        model=\"LLaMA_CPP\",\n        messages=[\n            {\n                \"role\": \"system\",\n\t\t\t\t\"content\": \"You are SummariserBot. You will ONLY respond with summaries of the messages send to you. Every summary will be a list of bullet points. Every bullet point will be one sentence. use markdown to format your messages.\",\n            },\n            {\n                \"role\": \"user\",\n                \"content\": note_content,\n            },\n        ],\n```\n\nNow, I love the idea behind `llamafile` and find the tech itself feels magical: I mean, it's an executable LLM that you can run on Win/Linux/Mac with almost zero config! \n\t\nWhy `ollama` then? You can think of ollama as the \"iTunes of LLMs\" ‚Äî it's an app that manages and runs the LLMs on your local machine. It's also trivial to use and provides a decent, not too large, selection of models. I think that the latter point is their main value ‚Äî it's easy to get overwhelmed when comparing LLMs.\n\nI noticed that the `llamafile` models I had on my machine didn't perform as well as `llama2` I had installed via `ollama`. I attribute this mainly to my lack of experience, not the tool itself.\n\n### llava vs llama2\n\nLLaVA is a multi-modal LLM capable of handing image and text input. LLaMA2 is a text-only foundation LLM. [To my knowledge](https://github.com/haotian-liu/LLaVA/blob/main/docs/LLaVA_from_LLaMA2.md), LLaVA is based on LLaMA1, which might explain why it performed worse than LLaMA2 on my summarisation tasks.\n\nI'm almost certain I could get both to work well enough by tweaking the prompts and inference settings.\n\n\n## Next steps\n\nThe 2 use cases I have here are not that exciting, but now I have a sandbox to play with:\n\n- detect commonly used phrases\n- provide follow-up questions to notes\n- rephrase my notes using a different language\n\nAlso:\n\n- try different, larger models, tweak inference settings\n- use RAG to ask questions about my notes\n\n## Summary \n\nThis is just a quick sketch made for fun, but you can get much better results by choosing the right model or just pre-processing the text before jumping into ML. LLMs work well as a \"calculator for words\" ([source](https://simonwillison.net/2023/Apr/2/calculator-for-words/)), and are decent at automating the boring stuff, but learning requires effort, so there's a limit to how much I'd like to offload to llama.\n\n\n[New Week](<../New Week>)\n\nRelated: [Ollama releases Python and JavaScript Libraries | Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39125477)\n"

If I saw an app that looked like this, I'd use it because it speaks to me.\n\nPersonalising software used to be a deliberate process: I could choose my WinAmp skin or change the way my crappy Windows 95 desktop looked (I had a really old computer so I'd spend ages pimping it up.) A big part of what makes personalisation fun is, well, *making* it fun, putting in the work. \n\nI want more handmade objects in my life, whether they are physical or digital.

Most of the interactions I have with people through my work or <a href=\"https://sonnet.io/posts/hi\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Say Hi</a> are unusually positive. People, overwhelmingly, are kind (<a href=\"../Share%20your%20unfinished,%20scrappy%20work\">Share your unfinished, scrappy work</a>).</p>\n<p>On the rare occasion I spot a troll in the wild, I feel that familiar little shitty spark‚Ñ¢ and need to exercise willpower not to take the bait. At the same time, it takes me <em>ages</em> to reply to people engaging with my work in a positive or constructive way. Why is that?</p>\n<p>(This is my personal take, so take it with a truck of salt. I still hope that you'll find something that resonates with your own experience.)</p>\n<h3>Reasons replying to overly negative comments feels easy</h3>\n<p><strong>Negativity bias, insecurity and compulsion</strong> (a.k.a. the charcoal, saltpeter and sulphur of any good social media thread):</p>\n<ol>\n<li>we're already more likely to focus on the negatives, and</li>\n<li>we mistake a negative comment for a threat to our position in the herd (an old and very strong instinct in tweeting bald apes), so</li>\n<li>we act compulsively by biting back (but why bite and hiss when one can <a href=\"https://mrr.sonnet.io\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">mrr</a>?).</li>\n</ol>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Side note: this is not much different from the way most click-bait articles and ads work. After the dopamine hit, there's a sense of emptiness. (You can fill that void by subscribing to NordVPN or HelloFresh.)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Years of practice play a role here too: many families, and most of our schools and jobs prioritise punishing mistakes over helping us learn from them.</p>\n<p>This topic has been beaten to death and I'm trying to keep this note short, so I'll stop here.</p>\n<h3>Reasons replying to positive feedback feels hard</h3>\n<p><strong>The lack of experience</strong> in <em>handling</em> positive feedback and people expressing their kindness. Many of us have not been taught how to do it. This creates friction, it <em>feels</em> hard to respond to positive messages as much as it feels hard to utter a complete sentence in a language you've just started learning (or, in my case, play any guitar solo that is not Come as You Are.)</p>\n<p><strong>Fear that the response might not live up to expectations.</strong>  Deep down I think that I'm just not good enough (but the people who reached out haven't figured that out yet.) Responding to a comment, DM or email is a deeper form of interaction. This makes me more exposed, there are more ways to trip. <em>Now</em>, they'll realise that <strong>I</strong>'m a fraud and didn't deserve any of their effort.</p>\n<p>This is as rational as playing chess with your limbic system can ever be, but in practical terms, I'm not consciously thinking about any of that, but instead distract myself with something else and procrastinate.</p>\n<h3>How I approach this:</h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Again, this works for the brain sponge who wrote this. Most of the \"anti-procrastination\" advice doesn't work for me, but learning about why we act a certain way and setting up systems to accommodate that seems to be a better approach (<a href=\"https://sonnet.io/posts/hummingbirds/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Hummingbirds are Evil! Procrastination, Laziness and Play </a>).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Practice replying frequently.</strong> The reason it feels hard is precisely because you're learning. The more I do it, the easier and less scary it gets.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Side note: whereas a younger brain can learn somewhat passively, in the case of adults neuroplasticity is achieved through either repetition or trauma.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Time-box replies.</strong> It's much easier to reply when I force myself to do that in a specified, very short amount of time (e.g. 1 pomodoro for <em>n</em> emails, <a href=\"../Deadlines%20Bring%20Focus\">Deadlines Bring Focus</a>).</p>\n<p><strong>Learn to enjoy it by paying more attention to it.</strong> I know this sounds silly, but I keep a folder with screenshots of emails/comments/DMs from people who had something nice to say about my work or if it resonated with them.

    "rawInput": "![https://res.cloudinary.com/dlve3inen/image/upload/v1705336700/card-suspicious-quote_osfmmv.png](https://res.cloudinary.com/dlve3inen/image/upload/v1705336700/card-suspicious-quote_osfmmv.png)\n\nI'm quite lucky. Most of the interactions I have with people through my work or [Say Hi](https://sonnet.io/posts/hi) are unusually positive. People, overwhelmingly, are kind ([Share your unfinished, scrappy work](<../Share your unfinished, scrappy work>)).\n\nOn the rare occasion I spot a troll in the wild, I feel that familiar little shitty spark‚Ñ¢ and need to exercise willpower not to take the bait. At the same time, it takes me *ages* to reply to people engaging with my work in a positive or constructive way. Why is that? \n\n(This is my personal take, so take it with a truck of salt. I still hope that you'll find something that resonates with your own experience.)\n\n### Reasons replying to overly negative comments feels easy\n\n**Negativity bias, insecurity and compulsion** (a.k.a. the charcoal, saltpeter and sulphur of any good social media thread):\n\n1. we're already more likely to focus on the negatives, and\n2. we mistake a negative comment for a threat to our position in the herd (an old and very strong instinct in tweeting bald apes), so\n3. we act compulsively by biting back (but why bite and hiss when one can [mrr](https://mrr.sonnet.io)?).  \n\n> Side note: this is not much different from the way most click-bait articles and ads work. After the dopamine hit, there's a sense of emptiness. (You can fill that void by subscribing to NordVPN or HelloFresh.)\n\nYears of practice play a role here too: many families, and most of our schools and jobs prioritise punishing mistakes over helping us learn from them. \n\nThis topic has been beaten to death and I'm trying to keep this note short, so I'll stop here. \n\n### Reasons replying to positive feedback feels hard\n\n**The lack of experience** in *handling* positive feedback and people expressing their kindness. Many of us have not been taught how to do it. This creates friction, it *feels* hard to respond to positive messages as much as it feels hard to utter a complete sentence in a language you've just started learning (or, in my case, play any guitar solo that is not Come as You Are.)\n\n**Fear that the response might not live up to expectations.**  Deep down I think that I'm just not good enough (but the people who reached out haven't figured that out yet.) Responding to a comment, DM or email is a deeper form of interaction. This makes me more exposed, there are more ways to trip. *Now*, they'll realise that **I**'m a fraud and didn't deserve any of their effort.\n\nThis is as rational as playing chess with your limbic system can ever be, but in practical terms, I'm not consciously thinking about any of that, but instead distract myself with something else and procrastinate.\n\n### How I approach this:\n\n> Again, this works for the brain sponge who wrote this. Most of the \"anti-procrastination\" advice doesn't work for me, but learning about why we act a certain way and setting up systems to accommodate that seems to be a better approach ([Hummingbirds are Evil! Procrastination, Laziness and Play ](https://sonnet.io/posts/hummingbirds/)).\n\n**Practice replying frequently.** The reason it feels hard is precisely because you're learning. The more I do it, the easier and less scary it gets.\n\n> Side note: whereas a younger brain can learn somewhat passively, in the case of adults neuroplasticity is achieved through either repetition or trauma.\n\n**Time-box replies.** It's much easier to reply when I force myself to do that in a specified, very short amount of time (e.g. 1 pomodoro for *n* emails, [Deadlines Bring Focus](<../Deadlines Bring Focus>)). \n\n**Learn to enjoy it by paying more attention to it.** I know this sounds silly, but I keep a folder with screenshots of emails/comments/DMs from people who had something nice to say about my work or if it resonated with them. It felt uncomfortable at first, but I know there's no rational reason it should. \n\n### Another (potential) reason\n\nA friend once asked me: *why do you apologise so often?* \nIt's safer to say *I'm sorry* than to say *thank you*.\n\n\n[Why is it So Hard to Respond to Positive Comments (longer article draft)](<../Why is it So Hard to Respond to Positive Comments (longer article draft)>)\n\n\n#article-idea \n"

[Share your unfinished, scrappy work](<../Share your unfinished, scrappy work>).\n\n**It's more honest.** Both as individuals and as a society we need to acknowledge that failure and struggle are necessary and welcome. Working with the garage door up means exposing more than just the happy path.\n\nWe're surrounded by so much grift, so many people trying to sell us shit we don't need, that even words like *vulnerable* trigger our bullshit filters. The thing is -- that type of messaging is worthless *precisely* because there's nothing behind it. Sharing your own [scrappy](<../Share your unfinished, scrappy work>) work and *showing the process behind it* are the opposite of that. People appreciate it.\n\n**You're likely to meet more interesting people this way.** And the connections you'll form will be deeper, partially because the people who will reach out to you share something with you. \n\nYou'll feel more confident. I struggle with perfectionism and I feel very uncomfortable sharing my work as I work on it. At the same time I envy the people who can do that. I don't think this is a matter of ego, but rather how calm and confident they seem. \n\n\n\n\nThere's something beautiful about sharing your work regularly. It feels rewarding. \n\n\n- more true\n- more honest (not just the happy winning path)\n- there's something beautiful about showing your work regularly\n- it keeps me accountable\n- it helps me become less shy (like with drawings or charging for Enso)\n\n#fleeting\n\n\n\n\nReference: [Andy Matuschak](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/zCMhncA1iSE74MKKYQS5PBZ) \n\n- there's something beautiful about showing your work regularly\n- it keeps me accountable\n- it helps me become less shy (like with drawings or charging for Enso)\n\n\n---\n\n[I could restart the mini-notes this way](<../Project ideas>) (update 2023-12-06 ha, we're already doing this!)\n\nYou might be interested in¬†[¬ßWhat‚Äôs top of mind](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/zPKTSiU725W9WQCqoVPBcxm).\n\nParent: [Make](<../Make>) \n"

This post will focus on the present and the future: the stuff I'm actively developing and hope to eventually share.</p>\n<p>First, why kind and what's kind software? Here's a working definition:</p>\n<p>Kind software is the one that supports my own well-being. It doesn't get in my way, it doesn't try to extract value from me. Its purpose is to help first and be sustainable within my own means (time, attention, money).</p>\n<h2>Wishlist</h2>\n<p>(I'll come up with nicer names, I promise.)</p>\n<h3>Mental health Toolbox</h3>\n<p>An app with a list of tools you can reach out to when distracted, feeling down, stressed, anxious, low on motivation. It's highly personalised and co-created together with the user, so details will vary.</p>\n<p>It's very low-tech. In fact you can imagine it as a deck of Pokemon/MtG cards, where each card is a thing you can <em>do</em> or <em>think of</em> to get out of your head and respond to whatever challenge lies ahead of you, constructively.</p>\n<p>Examples:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>when I feel stressed or that I'm rushing, I draw a card telling me to pet my dog.</li>\n<li>when I'm distracted and noticed that I'm wasting my time on HN, I read a random Wikipedia page, or someone's digital garden (both are beautiful rabbit holes)</li>\n<li>when I'm feeling down, I give my partner a hug</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In a sense this is a deck building game, where instead of cards you collect (or create) new tools to work with and shape yourself.</p>\n<p>Inspirations:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://toolbox.hyperisland.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Hyper Island Toolbox</a> (problem-based discovery, ignore the rest)</li>\n<li>Card games (classic or collectible/deck building)</li>\n<li>Tinder (card swiping UX)</li>\n<li>CBT</li>\n<li>cigarettes (especially nicotine addiction and how it implants itself as a trigger)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>![](Pasted image 20230929162213.png)</p>\n<h3>Pickle</h3>\n<p>Pickle is not a timer, but a metronome for my attention.</p>\n<p>I'm <strong>not</strong> looking for a Pomodoro tracker. Most of them either have a surprisingly overcomplicated UX or try to be time trackers. I don't have time for that.</p>\n<p>What I need is:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>adaptable work interval durations\n<ul>\n<li>(e.g. longer in the morning and late afternoon, shorter in the evening)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>being able to start and stop the timer easily</li>\n<li>being able to switch to a \"theme\" (not even a task) easily</li>\n<li>(optional) record topics somewhere (text, file, calendar, notes)</li>\n<li>(optional) should be able to meow when the break ends (keeps my dog sharp and excited)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>What I don't need is:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>time sheets</li>\n<li>to rate your app on the app store</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Why not an egg timer or a mobile app?</p>\n<p>Egg timers are noisy and I don't work alone. My fingers are too big for the touch screen of my phone. Finally, egg timers generally don't meow. Otherwise, yes, I'd go full egg. I'd even meow at an egg like this <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aRsWk4JZa5k\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">old Turkish man</a>.</p>\n<p>Random trivia:<br>\nManichaeans (including one of the Catholic Church fathers‚ÄìSt Augustine) used to consider cucumbers sacred? Melons and <em>cucumbers of light</em> would help liberate the soul from the body.</p>\n<p>My ambitions for the humber pickle are just that, humble.</p>\n<h3>An everything canvas</h3>\n<p>This is big and more people are working on one or another facet of this problem, so I'll keep it relatively high-level.</p>\n<p>Imagine an infinite canvas that doesn't operate on images, text, media, but <em>objects</em>. An object could be static like a media file or a piece of text, but it could also be a small computer program, or a primitive dealing with transforming information.</p>\n<p>Examples of objects:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>a note with a single word</li>\n<li>a picture</li>\n<li>an audio file</li>\n<li>a <em>thing</em> that arranges its content in a grid</li>\n<li><strong>a <em>thing</em> that given text returns a summarised version of that text</strong></li>\n<li><strong>a <em>thing</em> that looks like a queue with an input and an output</strong></li>\n<li><strong>a <em>thing</em>, an <em>NPC</em> who walks around the board and adds questions to your notes</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Steve Ruiz, the author of tldraw, said that infinite canvasses are a bit like 2D games where you move the camera. I think he hit the nail on the head here.</p>\n<p>When I hear that metaphor what I think is RTS games:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>borrowing certain RTS UX primitives, e.g. selection, camera panning</li>\n<li>managing information amount and density (fog of war, LoD)</li>\n<li>NPCs (perhaps as Matt Webb's <a href=\"https://twitter.com/genmon/status/1697261981814985139\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Dolphins</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Stephan Nago talks about turning ideas into objects and I imagine that this is at least partially where they'd like to go with the Obsidian canvas. I also like that they use files as the base primitive.</p>\n<p>But, I also think that we can go one step farther and merge a canvas with a programming environment, without letting people know they're programming.</p>\n<p>When it comes to computing, everyone focuses on Moore's Law, whether more interesting trends are: gradually increasing abstractions and shortening the distance between user intent and the result.</p>\n<p>Inspirations:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Mother of All Demos (of course)</li>\n<li>N8N</li>\n<li>Figma, Miro, Mural and all their cousins</li>\n<li>Obsidian</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>a better voice recorder (for slavic-language accent-challenged people)</h3>\n</details>\n</article>\n\n<p class=\"widget-subscribe\">\n  Want to receive my work as I publish it?\n  <a href=\"https://letters.sonnet.io/profile/posts\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>Subscribe here</strong></a>.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<script>\ndocument.addEventListener(\"DOMContentLoaded\", () => {\n    const images = document.querySelectorAll(\"article img[loading='lazy']\");\n\n    images.forEach(img => {\n        if (img.complete) {\n            img.classList.add(\"image--is-loaded\");\n        } else {\n            img.addEventListener(\"load\", () => {\n                img.classList.add(\"img--is-loaded\");\n            });\n        }\n    });\n});\n</script>\n</main>\n\n    <footer>\n      By üêê and <a href=\"https://sonnet.io\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Rafal Pastuszak</a>.

An object could be static like a media file or a piece of text, but it could also be a small computer program, or a primitive dealing with transforming information.\n\nExamples of objects:\n\n- a note with a single word\n- a picture\n- an audio file\n- a *thing* that arranges its content in a grid\n- **a *thing* that given text returns a summarised version of that text**\n- **a *thing* that looks like a queue with an input and an output**\n- **a *thing*, an *NPC* who walks around the board and adds questions to your notes** \n\nSteve Ruiz, the author of tldraw, said that infinite canvasses are a bit like 2D games where you move the camera. I think he hit the nail on the head here. \n\nWhen I hear that metaphor what I think is RTS games:\n\n- borrowing certain RTS UX primitives, e.g. selection, camera panning\n- managing information amount and density (fog of war, LoD)\n- NPCs (perhaps as Matt Webb's [Dolphins](https://twitter.com/genmon/status/1697261981814985139))\n\nStephan Nago talks about turning ideas into objects and I imagine that this is at least partially where they'd like to go with the Obsidian canvas. I also like that they use files as the base primitive. \n\nBut, I also think that we can go one step farther and merge a canvas with a programming environment, without letting people know they're programming.\n\nWhen it comes to computing, everyone focuses on Moore's Law, whether more interesting trends are: gradually increasing abstractions and shortening the distance between user intent and the result. \n\nInspirations:\n\n- Mother of All Demos (of course)\n- N8N\n- Figma, Miro, Mural and all their cousins\n- Obsidian\n\n\n\n### a better voice recorder (for slavic-language accent-challenged people)\n\n\n</details>\n"

Or rather: *using a non-linear publishing tool that reflects the way I think and iterate works **really** well*. There are some parts of Obsidian I don't like, but for now it's *good enough*. \n\nMind you, these are not issues with the product itself but my use-case and personal philosophy. I want something less clever, just a hypertext editing tool with pictures and links. When I say hypertext I mean it in its strictest, pre-web sense: a bunch of linked text documents.\n\nI also wish Obsidian Publish offered better customisation, was slightly more performant, and had better custom domain support. There will be a review of both coming soon. ([Obsidian (personal review)](<../../../Obsidian (personal review)>), [Abusing and reviewing Obsidian Publish](<../../../Abusing and reviewing Obsidian Publish>)).\n\nThe bottomline is that I can say more, using fewer words, and it's easier for me to manage my time (juggle research, writing, [Say Hi](https://sonnet.io/posts/hi) calls, looking for clients).\n\nAlso, I didn't have as much time to read as I would've liked to, but luckily I've had a tonne of Say Hi calls and the people I met gave me some really good brain-food!\n\n## Interesting stuff\n\n<span id=\"^bab3f9\" class=\"link-marker\">^bab3f9</span>\n\n**Favourite article:** [Muddle Your Way To Success](https://xeny.net/Muddle%20Your%20Way%20To%20Success)\n\n> *(I bet you like it)*\n\nThis is the body of a message sent by a reader of [Dog mode](<../../../Dog mode>). Yes, I did like it. I think you might as well.\n \n\n**Favourite project:** [yay.boo](https://yay.boo)\n\n[Beautifully](<../../../Brutally simple>) simple drag & drop website publishing tool. \n\nA part of me wishes that's where Zeit, now know as Vercel, had stopped. Give it a go and don't forget to check their [favourite sites](https://yay.boo/favorites) gallery.\n\n**Favourite piece of tech:** [PartyKit](https://www.partykit.io)\n\nLearned about it from [Matt Webb](https://twitter.com/genmon). \nRelated: [Exploring AI interaction design and multiplayer with tldraw](https://blog.partykit.io/posts/ai-interactions-with-tldraw) \n\nThis is very timely as I'm working on a little project which could be simplified quite a bit with PartyKit. More on that next week!\n\n### Cat printers\n\n![2587](cat%20printer%20aliexpress.webp)\n*Cat Printers are tiny BTLE cat-shaped printers.*\n\nFor a couple of years now I've been playing with the idea of using a network of tiny, Bluetooth-activated printers to send my friends short, physical, tangible messages. \nImagine a pretty wooden box sitting on your desk. Once in a while it starts buzzing and  produces a quick note from a friend, or a doodle. When was the last time you received a letter that was not a bill, or an ad? Imagine how that would that make you feel.\n\n\nI made some progress on the idea a couple of weeks back, inspired by the work of [Good Enough](https://guestbook.goodenough.us) and [Berg](https://nordprojects.co/projects/littleprinters/). There's also an [\"*almost*-community\"](<../../../Cat Printer ‚Äì tools and resources>) of people hacking with this stuff (*almost*, as it's not centralised, just smaller branches, groups of people).\n\nI'd like to write about this more in detail, but in short:\n\n- the hardware has become **significantly** cheaper\n- it's relatively easy to hack\n- you don't need to be a hardware expert to control it the printer programmatically (there are decent high-level python libraries to take care of that)\n\nHaving said that, there are still issues with making it a sustainable business. I don't care about scale, but I do care about being able to pay rent. Do you think becoming a *boutique handmade digital printer craftsman* is a valid career path? Let me know.\n\n![X](https://twitter.com/rafalpast/status/1700920284633551275)\n\n\n### Webrings and IndieWeb\n\nI visited a site written in a voice I really enjoyed. I opened their *webring* section and it had only one item there - a link to [sonnet.io](https://sonnet.io). I melted a little bit.\n\n#### Marginalia.nu and Website Explorer\n[Marginalia](https://explore.marginalia.nu/view) is a non-commercial search engine maintained by Victor Lofgren.\n\nThe site also contains a [StumbleUpon-like random site browser](https://explore.marginalia.nu/view). \nI use it when I feel like reaching for Reddit.

But, I need to make it sustainable if I want continue working this way as well as continue paying the rent.\n\nObsidian Publish is good enough for the next few weeks (for my use case), but as soon as I have more time, I'll play with something leaner where I have more control over appearance and accessibility.\n\nI'm working on several posts and demos related to this subject.\n\n\n### Next week:\n\nIn order of importance/deliverability:\n\n- I will keep all of the notes under 500 words\n- I will publish one follow-up on the existing notes\n- **I'd also like to spend more time with [Sit., (together)](<../../../Sit., (together)>) and share a prototype, even if it's just a [toy](<../../../Sit., (together)>).**  \n- Learn more about projects focused on improving mental health through nature and tech, like [Gardens of Things](https://gardensofthings.com).\n- Make a new home for my mental-health related projects ([Things to support my own well-being ‚Äì a wishlist](<../../../Things to support my own well-being ‚Äì a wishlist>)), here's a draft:\n![1720](kind.sonnet-mockup.webp)\n\n\n## Favourite project\n\n[Fluid Responsive Design | Utopia](https://utopia.fyi) ‚Äì I'm a bit of a typography nerd, and this thing just saved me from spending 2 hours yak-shaving. In short, fluid responsive design allows you do create visual hierarchies in CSS without having to resort to breakpoints. \n\n## Favourite site\n\n[GrEg teChnOLOGY](https://greg.technology)- a site made by one of the first people who contacted me via [Say Hi](https://sonnet.io/posts/hi). We bonded over our shared love of Roland Topor, but you should visit his site for [beautifully weird](<../../../beautifully weird>) experiments at the cross-section of product-dev, emerging tech and creative coding. \n\nBe sure to check out his current work at the [Recurse Center](https://recurse.greg.technology)‚Äìa 12-week-long program focused on helping engineers work at the edge of their abilities, through tackling projects that spark joy and curiosity. \n\n## Favourite piece of tech\n\n[Penpot](https://penpot.app) ‚Äì a free and open-source alternative to Figma. First, it's not a toy: unless your job requires you to use Figma, I can't think of many reasons not to use this instead. I know successful design-heavy [agencies](https://manufacturaindependente.org/about/) using it for all of their work.\n\nI ditched Adobe software after almost 20 years of use and never looked back. I did this *only partially* because of their predatory and illegal pricing practices and [vendor lock-in](https://blog.jim-nielsen.com/2023/precarious-modern-computing/#:~:text=Tools%20Like%20Figma%20Not%20Only%20Own%20Your%20Data%2C%20They%20Own%20Your%20Skillset). The main reason is that the alternatives are just so much better ([Alternatives to Adobe](<../../../Alternatives to Adobe>)). \n\nOne interesting feature of Penpot is that it uses open web standards under the hood (e.g. SVG, CSS), which means that things like autolayout or CSS units just work‚Ñ¢, where Figma has to play catch-up and reinvent the wheel.\n\n## Interesting articles\n\n[How to see beauty](https://ralphammer.com/how-to-see-beauty/) ‚Äì Few people can communicate ideas as concisely, precisely and poetically as Ralph Ammer. You'll see more of him in my updates in my future updates.\n\n\n[Notes from ‚ÄúWeathering Software Winter‚Äù by Devine Lu Linvega - Jim Nielsen‚Äôs Blog](https://blog.jim-nielsen.com/2023/precarious-modern-computing)\n‚Äì why \"Tools Like Figma Not Only Own Your Data, They Own Your Skillset\"\n\n[Getting Started with Large Language Models: Key Things to Know](https://flyte.org/blog/getting-started-with-large-language-models-key-things-to-know#what-are-llms) ‚Äì contains a decent overview of **Chain of thought (CoT) prompting** and **In-context learning (ICL)** and **Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)**. (You might want to skip the first part of the article.)\n\nContext length was a big limitation in my previous LLM-based projects and this article provides some strategies I can apply without getting a Data Science PhD.\n\n[The Baked Data architectural pattern](https://simonwillison.net/2021/Jul/28/baked-data/)‚Äìget the best of two worlds when it comes to statically generated sites and databases, by bundling the copy of your DB alongside the code of your application. \n\nI tried this approach (and failed miserably) when working on [Lemonade](https://lemonade.sonnet.io): I wanted to have a read-only searchable database of Lemmy instances, without having to deal with setting up databases an infra.\n\nHonestly, [Simon Willison](https://simonwillison.net) seems to be a one-man-StackOverflow for me at this stage. Check out his [TILs](https://til.simonwillison.net) and this [twitter thread](https://twitter.com/simonw/status/1711714615338627187) for more context.\n\n\n## Things I wrote last week that people liked\n\n- [Medieval Content Farm and Procedural Cheese ](https://untested.sonnet.io/Medieval+Content+Farm+and+Procedural+Cheese)‚Äìon embracing cheese in procedural art, taxidermy, and NSFW medieval poetry\n- [Sit., (together)](https://untested.sonnet.io/Sit.%2C+(together))‚Äìnew project: a group ~~meditation~~ *doing nothing* app, plus some multiplayer demos exploring non-verbal communication through presence.\n\n## News\n![5845](oranges-ants.webp)\n\n**Starting this November, I'm available for consulting work! Got an idea worth building? [Give me a shout!](mailto:hello@sonnet.io)** \n\nYou can find the list of services I offer on my new and shiny **[Consulting Page](https://consulting.sonnet.io)**\n\nP.S. I offer (very generous) discounts for businesses focused on social good.\n\n\nThanks for reading! See you on Monday!\n\n"

This generated a tonne of traffic and some great feedback from my users.</p>\n<p>Some context why I care about this more than I normally would: a bit more than a year ago I decided to take a break from traditional employment. I wanted to focus on my mental health, studying, experimentation, and finally ‚Äì figuring out if I can find a way to be useful to others while working on the things I love doing (<a href=\"../../../Be%20kind,%20be%20curious\">Be kind, be curious</a>).</p>\n<p>This isn't the first signal that I can make this work, but it's the first time when my work generated enough revenue to <em>aaaalmost</em> pay rent. I know this is just a temporary (and hardly the first) spike in traffic, but to be perfectly honest, I've been feeling quite rough and just needed some encouragement. The idea of being able to support myself felt real. I was able to visualise getting paid directly for my work. There's some irony here, as I'm much better at advising businesses or founders than tending to my little garden here.</p>\n<p>However, it was really hard to juggle the amount of booked Say Hi calls, job search, some personal (family) matters, then writing and research, plus coding on top of all of that. I'm happy that I kept going and I feel like every post here was useful (or at least mildly entertaining).</p>\n<p>At the same time I had almost no time to read, and any creative work felt like a chore.

This generated a tonne of traffic and some great feedback from my users. \n\nSome context why I care about this more than I normally would: a bit more than a year ago I decided to take a break from traditional employment. I wanted to focus on my mental health, studying, experimentation, and finally ‚Äì figuring out if I can find a way to be useful to others while working on the things I love doing ([Be kind, be curious](<../../../Be kind, be curious>)). \n\nThis isn't the first signal that I can make this work, but it's the first time when my work generated enough revenue to *aaaalmost* pay rent. I know this is just a temporary (and hardly the first) spike in traffic, but to be perfectly honest, I've been feeling quite rough and just needed some encouragement. The idea of being able to support myself felt real. I was able to visualise getting paid directly for my work. There's some irony here, as I'm much better at advising businesses or founders than tending to my little garden here. \n\nHowever, it was really hard to juggle the amount of booked Say Hi calls, job search, some personal (family) matters, then writing and research, plus coding on top of all of that. I'm happy that I kept going and I feel like every post here was useful (or at least mildly entertaining).\n\nAt the same time I had almost no time to read, and any creative work felt like a chore. I hope it didn't become too apparent.\n\n### Next week\n\n<span id=\"^7e52c8\" class=\"link-marker\">^7e52c8</span>\n\n- publish [Abusing and reviewing Obsidian Publish](<../../../Abusing and reviewing Obsidian Publish>) ‚Äì some quick notes on how I'm using (or abusing) Obsidian publish and how I'd like to make it better for my own purposes.\n- focus on shorter notes (< 500 words)\n\n## Favourite project\n\n[Is It Toxic To?](https://iitt.chester.how) ‚Äì a quick way of checking if a plant is toxic to your pets. I love how snappy and intuitive it feels. The site errs on the side of caution: many plants marked as toxic are only such in large quantities. Don't panic if your dog just munched on a cherry tomato, just click on the attached article and read more, make salsa.\n\n## Favourite site\n\n[Chester's Garden](https://chester.how) ‚Äì Chester is the author of the above mentioned [Is It Toxic To?](https://iitt.chester.how) as well as a bunch of smaller projects like this series of mini hackathons small enough to fit around a [Foldaway](https://foldaway.space) table.\n\n[Buddhism for Vampires](https://buddhism-for-vampires.com) ‚Äì sharing partially due to my personal biases. Thanks to this website I came across [shi-ne meditation](https://vajrayananow.com/shi-ne-meditation) which inspired me to build [Sit.](https://sit.sonnet.io). Also, in a different life, I ran a coterie of Vampires roaming the dungeons of Krak√≥w.\n\n## Favourite piece of ~~tech~~ toy\n\n[Short Trip - Alexander Perrin](https://alexanderperrin.com.au/paper/shorttrip/) ‚Äì a 5-minute game/toy where you control a little funicular train passing through a series of tiny villages. \n\n[Matt Webb adding semantic search to Braggoscope](https://twitter.com/genmon/status/1720405077540651243) ‚Äì Braggoscope is a directory containing all episodes of *In Our Time*, one of the best radio shows/science podcasts I've had a chance to find.  <span id=\"^252d17\" class=\"link-marker\">^252d17</span>\n\nThe embeddings-powered semantic search works really well there!

I also stole the shade of yellow used on his site and poured it allover my sweet ***Subscribe*** button.\n\n![4388](suspiria.webp)\n## Favourite piece of tech\n\n[Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/) ‚Äì What a blast from the past! Balsamiq is the OG wire-framing tool, known for its simplicity of use, solving one problem, but solving it really, really well. Also, I admire Peldi Guilizzoni's (Balsamiq's founder) approach to building sustainable, healthy, and ethical businesses. You can find out more in this [‚Äéepisode](https://podcasts.apple.com/gb/podcast/throwback-building-a-business-meant-to-last-with/id1206165808?i=1000555716446) of the Indie Hackers podcast.\n\n[Concepts](https://concepts.app/en/) ‚Äì Concepts is a highly customisable and stylus-friendly infinite canvas. I use it for most of my technical drawings, from architecture diagrams, project wireframes to lecture notes and doodles of a prototype dog toy I might build one day (spoiler: it'll probably lose to an empty kitchen roll filled with snacks).\n\n[RxJS](https://rxjs.dev) ‚Äì Another blast from the past, prompted by the rising popularity of signals as a paradigm in FE dev and [this toot](https://mas.to/@TodePond/111374640204129587). The RxJS way of handling events, state, and data flow fits so neatly with how my brain works. This is transferrable knowledge: I'm using RxJS or similar FRP libraries when working in other technologies (Unity, Java, Swift UI w. Compose). Most React state libs age like milk, but this aged like a delicious bottle of wine, let's call it *l'Observable*.\n\nThe second reason I'm adding it here is that I'll use it again in the next version of [Sit., (together)](<../../../Sit., (together)>).\n\n[NewPipe](https://newpipe.net) ‚Äì Alternative Youtube client for Android. Youtube started making the experience of using their service even more terrible for adblock users. If you're not on YT Red, and have an Android phone, give it a go (and use Firefox with ¬µblock origin on desktop).\n## Interesting articles\n\n[Quality software deserves your hard‚Äëearned cash ‚Äî Steph Ango](https://stephango.com/quality-software) ‚Äì Explains why I'm charging people for what's [essentially](<../../../Essentially>) a less capable text field.\n\n[summary.md](https://gist.github.com/simonw/d50c8634320d339bd88f0ef17dea0a03) ‚Äì Simon Willison's notes on the recent Open AI feature announcement. It's opinionated and concise.\n\n[Own Your Web](https://matthiasott.com/newsletter) ‚Äì \"a newsletter by¬†[Matthias Ott](https://matthiasott.com/?utm_source=ownyourweb&utm_medium=email)¬†about designing, building, creating, and publishing for and on the Web.\"\n\n[I try to code a PS1 game. - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYVGczdflyY) ‚Äì developing games for old systems is insanely difficult. This is an efficient way of both: 1) learning and 2) experiencing Schadenfreude.\n\n## Things I wrote last week that people liked\n\n- [Spiritual Volleyball](<../../../Spiritual Volleyball>)\n- [Leading or Line Height - a Measured Response](<../../../Leading or Line Height - a Measured Response>)\n\n\nThanks for reading! See you on Monday!\n\nP.S. If you enjoyed reading this post, consider donating [here](https://rafal.ck.page/products/tip).\n\n![7349](45-footer.webp)\n"

No shit, Sherlock! \n\n<img src=\"https://www.potato.horse/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.ctfassets.net%2Fhyylafu4fjks%2F1znVHk5xt8VlzsqHc46vV2%2Febf84f76cd57ca89cdab94547a2cadf6%2FUntitled_Artwork_11.png&w=3840&q=75\" alt=\"\"/>\n\nAs much as I'm learning to be impatient when it comes to [sharing](<../../../Share your unfinished, scrappy work>) my work, I'm also trying to get better at exercising patience when it comes to reaping the results. Luckily, this became much easier this week as we moved the needle a little bit on all fronts.\n\n**Night Reader is available on TestFlight. [Check it out here](https://testflight.apple.com/join/jn7XlV3M).** The feedback I've received so far is positive and more importantly‚Äîvery actionable.\n\nIn two days we almost reached the initial limit of 100 testers, which is surprising given how niche it is and how little effort I put into spreading the word about it. I mean, the main job of this app is reduce the number of photons leaving the screen.\n\nThe thing is, although I'm significantly busier and more tired than when I worked full-time, I feel like it's so much easier to carry on. Having something useful to share with others every single day keeps me just as anchored as [writing every morning](<../../../Stream of Consciousness Morning Notes>). Thank you.\n\n## Next week: \n\n- Night Reader:\n\t- apply the feedback I've received so far\n\t- publish on the App Store and/or add a product page\n- Stop scheduling writing prompts for the next week as I never follow through\n- Try sharing smaller, more TIL-style stories (think: [this tweet](https://twitter.com/rafalpast/status/1725218601408356830) with more technical context)\n\n## Favourite project(s)\n\n[bitsy](https://bitsy.org) ‚Äî Bitsy is a tiny engine for tiny games.

During my third one I'd go with [Black Soul Choir](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-vpAn15-vE).\n\n## Favourite site\n\n[Pink Trombone](https://dood.al/pinktrombone/) ‚Äî bare-handed speech synthesis. Pink Trombone is a UI/sound generator inspired by the human vocal apparatus. If you have any interest in music or linguistics (esp. phonetics), use it with headphones, because you might spend a non insignificant amount of time trying to reproduce the state of the UI with your own mouth (and likely get a bit sore, as I did.)\n\n[Arwes](https://arwes.dev/) ‚Äî Arwes is a futuristic Sci-Fi UI web framework, inspired by Halo, Tron, Synthwave.

ToiletPaper magazine is an avant-garde publication co-created by Maurizio Cattelan and Pierpaolo Ferrari. It's a mixture of commercial photography, and surreal, bizarre imagery. It's beautifully and unashamedly trashy, and that speaks to me at a deep and personal level. Keep scrolling, feed your eyes, and take a shower afterwards (then buy a physical copy).\n\n![3591](unim-press-screenshot.webp)\n[unim.press](https://unim.press) ‚Äì Reddit Front Page reader in the style of New York Times.

My main issue with Web Components was scalability and composability, but after seeing [more work using this tech](https://github.com/genmon/braggoscope-search), I'm starting to notice more value in it from the perspective of my own personal practice.\n\nSide note: if you're interested in JAMStack, be sure to fill in the [The Future of Jamstack](https://thefutureofjamstack.org) survey (it's short.)\n\n[5 Animals Whose Blood Isn't Red | HowStuffWorks](https://animals.howstuffworks.com/animal-facts/5-animals-whose-blood-isnt-red.htm) - Sharing this for very selfish and idiosyncratic reasons: I caught myself reading it in Night Reader and had a pretty good experience **despite my app using only three colours: black, red, dark red**.\n\n[No feature](https://ia.net/topics/no-feature) ‚Äî an opinion piece discussing how brittle and myopic the mainstream approach towards building AI apps is at the moment, plus some (vague) directions on how to move forward.

OK, that's 6 arms, so perhaps the bubble is more like an insect, a bumblebee, let's call it a bubble-bee. *Ah, ja... the noble bubble-bee, a creature of never-ending dichotomies, it neither buzzes nor sings, but screams, trapped between the liquid and the solid state, yet still, somehow, sublime.

    "rawInput": "## Meta\n\nReminder: this site is an [iterative experiment](<../../../111>), so let's ~~put on the janitor hat~~ jibble:\n![227](53/jibble.webp)\n\n## This week's summary\n\nI'll keep this one short. I've had 10 Say Hi calls this week, 9 of them with people I've never met before. A part of me wishes I could share more about them here. But, one of the reasons I enjoy them so much is their anonymity by default. These calls, along with writing and studying, are taking a lot of my time (+30h per week), and I'll have to make some changes to the writing schedule. \n\nI will take advice from the man who decided to [walk for vice president](https://www.w4vp.com)‚Äîinstead of stopping and making drastic changes, I'll slow down. More on that next week.\n\nAn unexpected side effect of writing/building here plus chatting with random internet strangers‚Ñ¢ as a part-time job is that I'm getting more recommendations to put here (more than I can find via [Places to Find Indie Web Content](<../../../Places to Find Indie Web Content>)!). Sometimes, if I'm lucky, they send me something they made themselves and I put it here.\n\n### Next week\n\n- Learn more and write about [Asemic Writing](<../../../Asemic Writing>)\n- Stick to shorter notes\n- Share one experiment\n\n## Favourite project\n\n![1303](53/gnorp.gif)\n[(the) Gnorp Apologue](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1473350/the_Gnorp_Apologue/) ‚Äî \"(the) Gnorp Apologue is the journey of the gnorps as you guide them towards their goal of delightfully excessive wealth accumulation.\" (reader recommendation) <span id=\"^8723e6\" class=\"link-marker\">^8723e6</span>\n\n![1576](53/atkinson.webp)\n[Atkinson Hyperlegible](https://brailleinstitute.org/freefont) ‚Äî a free typeface optimised for visually-impaired people (reader recommendation.)\n\nDespite its use-case, it **does not** feel like a compromise. It's very legible even with low contrast, it ensures that characters are maximally distinguishable, but at the same time it feels very polished (e.g. it's waaaay better kerned than most of the web fonts I see).\n\n## Favourite site\n\n[mymind](https://mymind.com)‚Äî I'm a sucker for bold, serif typography and their colour palette. I don't think I'd use their product, because I don't want vendor lock-in for my second brain, but the site looks gorgeous and I want it to have babies with more websites, more designs. Then, put them here in my tiny serif font zoo.\n\n## Favourite piece of tech\n\n![2391](53/computer-dealer.jpg)\n\n[ArVid: how Russians squeezed 4 hard drives into one VHS tape in the 90s ‚Äì Jacob Filipp](https://jacobfilipp.com/arvid-vhs/) ‚Äî  I wasn't born in post-Soviet Russia, but this article took me back to a familiar place. I remember buying game magazine CDs at a flea market in Vienna, or travelling for 1.5h from my village in the mountains to Krak√≥w ‚Äì just to get a totally legit copy of Diablo 1 at a bazaar. \n\nVisit for the time travel, stay for the tech. It's a longer read but it's done by someone who doesn't just know what they're talking about. It's a labour of love.\n\n\n[Val Town](https://www.val.town)‚Äî val.town is a social site/code platform allowing you to build and deploy small functions/code sketches. Their pitch:\n\n*If GitHub Gists could run*\n*And AWS Lambda were fun*\n\nIt has a pretty comprehensive \"standard library\" (or set of available packages) including features such as: HTTP responses, CRON jobs or even sending emails with a single import + function call (zero config)! \n\n\n![3409](../../touch-designer-cover.png)\n*Node-based programming explained in a single drawing*\n\n[TouchDesigner | Derivative](https://derivative.ca/UserGuide/TouchDesigner) ‚Äî TouchDesigner is a node-based visual programming tool used for interactive media installations, processing/p5.js style generative art, multimedia performances. I wrote about it more extensively here: [TouchDesigner (and Mr Noto, the Talking Ball)](<../../../TouchDesigner (and Mr Noto, the Talking Ball)>).\n\n## Interesting articles\n\n![](https://blog.gingerbeardman.com/images/posts/ultimate-classic-macintosh-1.jpg)\n\n[Turning an iPad Pro into the Ultimate Classic Macintosh ‚åòI¬†¬†Get¬†Info](https://blog.gingerbeardman.com/2021/04/17/turning-an-ipad-pro-into-the-ultimate-classic-macintosh/)‚Äî [Math Sephton](https://twitter.com/gingerbeardman) creates PlayDate games. He also turned his iPad into a Macintosh and uses to to create 1-bit wood block art. It looks gorgeous.\n\n[grid: dabble in precision: fundamental principles](https://cssprinciples.com/3/grid/)‚Äî an interactive **very comprehensive** intro to CSS grid. \n\n[Mario Zechner (Mastodon)](https://mastodon.cloud/@badlogic@mastodon.gamedev.place/111818406701804569) ‚Äî Mario Zechner is an Austrian developer who became weirdly successful at using tech to [expose/ridicule corrupt politicians](https://www.wired.com/story/heisse-preise-food-prices/). To do so, he uses relatively simple tech in creative ways.

It's super comfortable. Or should I say *unquestionably* comfortable, as I'm still looking for the `?` key.\n\n*(I'm not kidding, I even contacted their support asking if this was some sort of a test to see if I can learn to customise the layout myself.)* \n\n#### CDN(-ot now please)\n\nVideos on untested stopped working due to the amount of traffic. Thanks for watching! I've upgraded my Cloudinary subscription for now, but will move to a simpler CDN setup (Bunny CDN, or uncle Bezos' simple storage shed). \n\nLessons learned: 1) Cloudinary is expensive 2) they read your tweets and are happy to give you a discount if you ask.\n\n#### Ens≈ç\n![1212](58/enso-screenshot.webp)\n\nI've finally started working on a new version of [Ens≈ç](https://enso.sonnet.io)! \n\nHistorically, I avoided making any significant changes to it and **I'll keep it this way**. Having said that, I'd like to give people the ability to customise it a bit and allow for easier migration of features between platforms (I don't want to keep the web version as a moat). \n\nEns≈ç is private and I don't nag anyone for testimonials. Still, I've received a lot of feedback over the past 5 years so I'd like to organise it a little bit and share.\n\n### Next week\n\n- one small update for Ens≈ç\n- likely no newsletter, blame [King Gizzard & The Lizard Wizard](https://kinggizzardandthelizardwizard.com)\n- drop everything and play with Playdate once it arrives\n- find the missing `?` on my keyboard (perhaps it's travelling with my Playdate, perhaps their ship's name is Demeter and they haven't departed from Varna yet). \n\n## Favourite project\n\n![2166](58/11ty-users.webp)\n\n[Eleventy (11ty)](https://www.11ty.dev) ‚Äì 11ty is a super simple, insanely flexible static site generator. It allows me to work with the web platform instead of piling trendy JS libraries on top of it. <span style='opacity: .2'>11ty is the Pedro Pascal of static site generators‚Äìit looks modern and spicy, but ages like fine wine (@editor, leave it, I said, LEAVE IT!).</span>\n\nIt has a wonderful, friendly community, and a ton of ready-made templates to get you started in case you want to focus on writing without getting distracted with bike shedding. I've been using it on [sonnet.io](https://sonnet.io) and a bunch of other projects for years. Even [the first version of untested](https://untested-30xjqk2l8-sonnet.vercel.app/posts/008/) was running on a basic 11ty template. \n\nFinally, [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/blog/sustainability-fundraising/) is on the way to becoming sustainable this year. \n\n![3097](58/gnormal.webp)\n\n[A Gnormal Journey by jess::codes](https://jess-hammer.itch.io/a-gnormal-journey) ‚Äì a small [Gnorp Apologue](<../53>) inspired game about fitting in. It looks neat, but the main reason I'm sharing it is the showcase video itself.\n\n![A Gnormal Journey](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MG6mpjDkS44)\n\nBy Jove! This is one of the best walkthroughs/examples illustrating the process of building a small indie game I've seen. It's super comprehensive, dense and fun. I'm looking forward to seeing more of her work.\n\n[Tauri](https://tauri.app) ‚Äì Tauri is a lightweight hybrid-app development platform. I'm using it with the current version of Ens≈ç and I'm planning to migrate to v2 of Tauri with Enso v2. \n\n\n![3821](58/telestron.webp)\n\n[The Munky King](https://gmunk.com/The-Munky-King) and  [Telestron](https://gmunk.com/Telestron)by GMUNK ‚Äì I spotted these two demos when reading about the Windows 10 wallpaper being done using [traditional photography](https://gmunk.com/Windows-10-Desktop/) rather than CGI. \n\nThe Munky King reminded of me [Fa√ßade](https://medium.com/werework-thinks/hello-this-is-fa√ßade-c20f7087b08d) ‚Äì a small DIY photo studio project I made almost a decade ago (ingredients: a bunch of screens + an old wardrobe salvaged from an antique store on Brick Lane). \n\n![4391](58/luna-facade.webp)\n*Taken using Fa√ßade. Check out the [gallery](https://500px.com/p/rafalpast/galleries/facade) and the [post-launch post](https://medium.com/@rafal/hello-this-is-fa√ßade-c20f7087b08d) here.*\n\nTelestron just looks like a very difficult shrine level from Zelda BotW. (or, like the future where humanity is ruled by an oligarchy of expensive, but beautiful D20s.)\n\n![My most beautiful creation yet: Ruby D20 - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GsBDQsxcyP0)\n\n## Favourite site\n\n![4891](58/pattern-kitchen.webp)\n\n[Pattern Kitchen](https://pattern.kitchen)‚Äì a collection of patterns or pattern languages across different disciplines. In the past, a large part of my work involved translating between people working in different domains (think: designers, engineers, publishers, writers). This looks like a project I would've loved to have seen/played with then.\n\n![5267](58/hyperlink-academy.webp)\n\n[Hyperlink Academy](https://hyperlink.academy)‚Äì a modern internet club and a platform to discuss and share your projects. I'm still messing with it and trying to decide if it's a good replacement for Discord or Slack based communities.

Learn more about how and why I made Fig [here](<../../../Fig>).\n\n### Toys, toys, toys!\n\nI'm still waiting for the Playdate to arrive. And, I'm a *very* impatient person (*a VIP, thanks Ms Editor*), so I sketched out a new game idea in the meantime. It's a roguelike game called *Walk my Dog*.

It reminded me this scene from Coppola's Dracula: \n\n![2472](59/red-sky-dracula.JPG)\n\nIt also made me reflect on how often and how I use [Midnight](https://midnight.sonnet.io).

    "rawInput": "## Meta\n\nReminder: this site is an [iterative experiment](<../../../111>), so let's ~~put on the janitor hat~~ **welcome this festive sock because we reached 111 posts you handsome beast**!\n![296](60/celebratory-sock.webp)\n\n\n## ~~This week's~~ summary\n\n### 111! \n\n> <sonnet-embed data-target=\"#^032fa8\">../../111.md</sonnet-embed>\n> ‚Äì yours truly, some time last year\n\nA few days back I read a post by someone who said that what prompted them to write was a thing I wrote/shared here. This wasn't the first time it happened. And every time it does, I feel a burst of happiness. *(thank you, mr vice-president, you know who you are)*\n\n![686](60/luna-and-mango-and-i.webp)\n\nI don't have a habit of celebrating milestones. I tend to just move on to the next thing. I don't think it's very healthy, and I'm trying to get better at this! But holy shit, we got there, and you're here with me! What the hell!\n\nI am so grateful that people read this thing, follow my work and sometimes even message me with the (oftentimes) [beautifully weird](<../../../beautifully weird>) stuff they found. I'm so grateful you came over and spent your time reading this. Let the cycle of playing, learning, breaking and half-assing things continue!\n\n#### Graaaaaains\n\n![1263](../../innocent-gradient-fun.webp)\nEarlier this week I published [Just Some Innocent Gradient Fun](<../../../Just Some Innocent Gradient Fun>). It's a simple visual editor showing how to shade an image using noise, gradient maps and posterisation. It was inspired by this [YT tutorial by Texture Labs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1poWgZWpsiY).\n\n### Next week\n\nIn the next few weeks, I might write a more detailed note on what I've learned through running this experiment. For now, things will continue in their current shape.\n\nThis, whatever this is, works for me. I have feeling I'll be doing it for another few years, so I'm considering dropping Obsidian Publish and merging untested with my [blog](https://sonnet.io) .\n\n## Favourite project\n\n![Dabu and Simon Swerwer - Drink and Industry (Lyric Video) - YouTube](https://youtu.be/W2Df3_k9PGM?list=OLAK5uy_n5khwuqZ3VzMmEXPRJHCuanEQuoxU5OQs&t=60)\n\n*Recommended soundrack for this section*\n\n[Dwarf Fortress](https://www.bay12games.com/dwarves/) ‚Äî I don't know how to describe it concisely. It's an **insanely** complex strategy/simulation/roguelike game where you manage a colony of dwarves. \n\n> *Remember: losing is fun!*  \n> ‚Äì literally the first thing you'll see after starting the game\n\nDF is notoriously difficult to start, has a terrible UX. But all of the self-inflicted torture can be a small price for one of the best examples of emergent narrative in gaming. Don't get me wrong, I'm terrible at DF, but that's kind of the point -- to me playing it feels like reading and writing a book at the same time, something I know mainly from running TTRPG sessions.\n\n![2840](60/dwarf-fortress.webp)\n\n*My current fortress is a small, sustainable, polyamorous (not religious but dare I say spiritual?) community. Think: Amishes on a rave. Our contact with the outside world comes from selling little wooden trinkets. We also have a 1-year old child who works at the stonemason's workshop. She's suffering from a little bout of demonic possession at the moment. Just as our ancestors in the mountainhome, we brew our ale from mushrooms.*\n\n## Favourite site\n\n![3321](60/matthew-rayfield.webp)\n\n[matthew rayfield world](https://matthewrayfield.com/?hidden=true) ‚Äî internet playthings and experiments like this [Popup Trombone](https://matthewrayfield.com/goodies/popup-trombone/) or  [console.log snake](https://matthew.rayfield.world/goodies/inspect-this-snake/). \n\nMatthew Rayfield (the current intern at matthewrayfield.com) also dabbles in accessibility, like this [snort'n'paste](https://matthewrayfield.com/projects/snort-n-paste/), targeted at Square Mile traders *(@editor: would you say it is a bit... on the nose?)*.\n\n![3882](60/humdrum.webp)\n\n[occasionally, humdrum](https://kinopio.club/yUa1agMD1UF1TFCHDoVgO) ‚Äî a semi-regularly updated assortment of media hosted in a kinopio board. In another world, untested is a giant kinopio canvas.\n\n[European Alternatives](https://european-alternatives.eu/)‚Äî EU based SaaS products *tend to* be less creepy from a privacy standpoint. I stumbled upon it when looking for a CDN alternative for my sites (including this one).\n\n![4323](60/damaged-earth.webp)\n\n[Damaged Earth Catalog](https://damaged.bleu255.com)‚Äî notes on the future of computing, ways of framing the relationship between humans, technology and our environment (e.g. [Benign Computing](https://damaged.bleu255.com/Benign_Computing/)). I'm still digging through it.\n\n> We are humans and might as well get used to it. So far, remotely done power and glory‚Äîas via government, big business, formal education, church‚Äîhas succeeded to the point where gross profits obscure actual loss. In response to this dilemma and to these losses a realm of intimate, community power is developing‚Äîpower of communities to conduct their own education, find their own inspiration, shape their own environment, and share their knowledge with others. Practices that aid this process are sought and promoted by the DAMAGED EARTH CATALOG.\n\n## Favourite piece of tech\n\n~~6 years, 1000s of doodles, dozen of t-shirts, and a couple of games later, I'm retiring my iPad. May it rest in peace (or in the living room as a Spotify GUI).~~\n\nNah, it's the [Playdate](https://play.date)! It arrived 20 minutes ago, after a 2-month long eurotrip with a stop in Las Vegas(?).\n\n![5495](60/playdate-vegas.webp)\n\n## Interesting articles\n\n[Inline conditionals in CSS?](https://lea.verou.me/blog/2024/css-conditionals/) ‚Äî Lea Verou discusses a  proposal to introduce ternary operator-like conditional logic in CSS. \n\nOK, it'll take another 2-3 years for it to be accepted and implemented in major browsers. The reason I'm sharing this: the article does a great job at explaining the *already existing* and stable ways of solving this problem.\n\nI like to think my CSS knowledge is solid, but I was today years old when I learned about `style()` media queries! \n\n![6067](60/mouse-separator.webp)\n\n[About ‚Äì webcurios](https://webcurios.co.uk/about/) ‚Äî Q&A with the author of webcurios, explaining their process and their attitude towards writing and sharing. Cheesy at it may sound, it feels honest and it truly embraces the beautiful art of [half-assing](<../../../Half-ass it>) and [sharing unfinished, scrappy work](<../../../Share your unfinished, scrappy work>). \n\n[Building community](https://www.todepond.com/wikiblogarden/blending/goals/community/)‚Äî *Is your work about ‚Äúinfluencing people‚Äù or is it about ‚Äúsolving hard problems‚Äù?*\n\n## Things I wrote last week that people liked\n\n- [Just Some Innocent Gradient Fun](<../../../Just Some Innocent Gradient Fun>)\n\nThanks for reading!
